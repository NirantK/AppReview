    "review": "Let me start by saying that this is, by far, the most excited I\u2019ve been about a new social network since Instagram first entered the ring. But, in my couple days of usage, I\u2019ve began to notice one thing that really stands out as being a bit annoying: lack of speaker indication. When rooms have a healthy amount of people on the stage, you find yourself playing a game of hide & seek as you tediously scroll to find who\u2019s avatar has the ring. So here\u2019s my 2 possible suggestions & wishes:\n\n1) As they already have for \u201cFollowed by Speakers\u201d, make a \u201cModerators\u201d section at the top of the room and a \u201cStage\u201d section below it. Then make it to where speaker notifications (\u201c___ is speaking\u201d as a drop down notification) are exclusive to when a moderator is speaking. This way, the amount of scrolling to find who is talking would be reduced to on stage participants only. And the audience will be alerted when a moderator is speaking.\n\n2) Decrease the profile sizes of those on stage as the number increases so that more avatars can fit on the screen. That way, when someone is speaking, we can see who it is without scrolling as much.",

    "review": "This app use to be Amazing back in January but now the app is overflowing with people taking over stages, removing mods to the audience and out of the room, people get mad at others for hosting popular rooms so they\u2019ll have and are paying people to report profiles on this app so the person can be suspended and then when this happens everyone migrates back to the person who sent the reporters. I also feel like there was no need to change the African American man from the apps profile picture either. Why does it always have to be a Caucasian person? We have Chinese Hispanic Dominican and all other races in the United States you could have picked from but you guys chose the one Caucasian man who \u201cbrought life\u201d to Club house as there are thousands of others whose brought life to the app as well. People want this app public and I believe you guys can continue to work on the app while doing so. It\u2019s just not the same, everyone makes rooms and we consistently get shadow banned for the oddest reasons, it\u2019s way too many rules to keep up with. Back in December and January people could get rooms up to 600+ now we barley get 200+ and that\u2019s why I believe the app needs to go public since everyone wants to become moderators now we can\u2019t engage with a lot of people anymore since everyone is spread out. Please consider all of these issues and maybe me and the others I\u2019ve spoken with will come back to the app but until then we will have to give Club house a break. -Thank You",

    "review": "I absolutely love clubhouse, the only thing that I dislike is industry people charging others to speak on a free platform that was built to create the connection between the industry world with individuals who are somewhat already in the industry. I feel like clubhouse needs to keep the app invite only maybe doing 1 invite every two months to stop the app from being over saturated like Facebook or Instagram where anyone can join. I think they need to have someone go into these rooms and make sure all guidelines are being met because most of them are not. This shouldn\u2019t be a popularity app, but a tool to help creative minds link with professionals and network. People should not be charged to enter a public room by people claiming to be professionals. Cashapp\u2019s should not be allowed in profile descriptions on a public platform. And I feel like being that the app was create to be an open form raising of hands should not be disabled. Moderators should just pick who that want on stage but not make someone feel less then by disabling hands.",

    "review": "I love this app because it allows you actually have a conversation with numerous people that you may have NEVER had the chance to talk to. But the one thing I that should change on this is maybe a space in the chat where the person who is talking make their picture bigger so that you can find their info, follow them on the app or on Instagram. Sometime I\u2019m trying to figure out who is talking to connect with them but I have to scroll down to see who is talking instead of their profile picture popping up a little bigger (like zoom, I hate to compare. But I think it should show a bigger picture of the person talking but still have all the little pictures of people in the discussions. And maybe move the IG icon next to the follow button so that you can get back to the chat quick without having to scroll all the way down. Could you guys also a question chat so it is easier to the moderators can answers questions for the audience of course allowing the mediators to pick which questions they would like to answer. Again this app is great !!! I look forward to seeing this app flourish wish y\u2019all the best.",

My IG and FB are suffering because I\u2019m all about Clubhouse every day all day. With that said, I\u2019m frustrated. I was accidentally logged out of my account today and can\u2019t get back in now. I\u2019ve searched high and low on how to successfully log back into my account and I don\u2019t see the information anywhere. Why isn\u2019t that easily available? I know I didn\u2019t delete my account but I can\u2019t get into my existing account anymore. I tried reaching out to Clubhouse support via email and Twitter and haven\u2019t received a response. I can admit it wasn\u2019t that long ago that I sent that info in but I was expected to be in a room and can\u2019t even access it now. The problem now is when I click on the app it\u2019s trying to make me sign up all over again. Asking me to pick a new user name. I need to access my groups and contacts so I\u2019m not trying to create a new user name. This review is to let it be know that Clubhouse is one of the best apps I\u2019ve been a part of in a  long time but how can I continue to enjoy it when I can\u2019t even access my account that\u2019s I\u2019ve grown to love? Can someone help me with this??",

I\u2019d love to have an \u201cadd to calendar\u201d function to save to an itinerary within the app (kinda like apps for academic conferences) so that I can see the things I\u2019m most interested in listed in a separate place from everything in the \u201cUpcoming for You\u201d tab. If this function was added, I\u2019d prefer to be able to be able to \u201cdouble-book\u201d in the itinerary if at all possible (e.g. so I can peruse a few rooms during one time slot before settling into the best fit for me and so, if my top choice room finishes first, I can jump over to my second choice before it\u2019s over).     2.) I\u2019d also like a way to \u201cfavorite\u201d/prioritize certain users and clubs so I see them at the top of the \u201cUpcoming for You\u201d tab.     3.) I\u2019d love to be able to search for room titles (and maybe descriptions?) using keyword search in the \u201cExplore\u201d tab.     4.) I\u2019d like for club meetings to be linked to their page so if I know somethings happening for one club, but it isn\u2019t scheduled in advance or I haven\u2019t saved it in my itinerary, I can quickly search for the club page and enter the room there.",

After joining Clubhouse I became aware of both how misguided I was about Clubhouse and how much as a new small business owner I needed this forum.\n\nThe connections I\u2019ve made have been various but all have been invaluable. I\u2019ve received what can arguably be tens of thousands of dollars worth of free advice about everything from branding to best business practices. The potential business collaborations are unfolding but I believe that they will be mutually beneficial.\n\nI think the big challenge for Clubhouse going forward is to not try to be a platform for all people and all things. I\u2019ve seen some of the rooms take on the postures and topics that are more \u201ctraphouse\u201d than Clubhouse. I am not advocating classism but I think that perhaps making \u201challways\u201d for certain types of rooms may be interesting (but this may create echo chambers that would be counter Clubhouse).",

So anyone who has ever had your phone number not only can see your profile, but also share it with anyone or any room without your consent (a giant red flag - at the time of writing there's no way to selectively restrict your profile to certain users). Which makes Clubhouse a superspreader feeding ground for stalkers.\nCurrently there's no way to simply delete your account, you can only request its removal and wait until someone attends to it - another red flag, that points at data collection, likely to sell it to third parties. At the time of writing Clubhouse \"temporarily\" stores voice recordings on their servers, which is a complete U-turn from their initial promises during the release. Some of the data the app collects from your phone has nothing to do with the service it provides - yet another red flag, and yet another app that treats its users as a product.\nOn top of that, despite the app being in its early days, there's little to no moderation of hateful and toxic content, making it easy to exploit for people spreading dangerous conspiracies.",

Before the update, I got to jump in and out of very diverse chats, from finance to music to psychology to poetry to straight up gossip chatrooms. After the update; my listening is very limited to the people I chose to follow and their interest in the two weeks I\u2019ve been on the app.\n\nClubhouse has turned itself into another Instagram app where it shows you targeted content based off of the content you \u201cliked\u201d when you first joined. I HATE IT HERE NOW.\n\nWhat made the app great for me was I had access every space, every topic, everyone everywhere (within the app, of course) with just a click on a globe. Now I have to scroll thru people I follow to find other people to follow in hopes the start an interesting room when in reality they are avid listeners and note takers like myself.\n\nSince you removed the explorer page, I can\u2019t expand my knowledge or explore other topics I may not have known existed. Since I didn\u2019t follow enough people early on, I lost access to many spaces including psychological and finance chats which is directly within my field. \n\n So now with such a heavy heart, I dislike the app because I\u2019m stuck listening to the same people talking about the same things every other day. \n\nCan y\u2019all bring back the explorer page?!

That being said, I do like having the ability to link my other social media profiles on my clubhouse profile, but the issue I have here is that you can only link one Instagram account and one Twitter. I personally only have one Twitter so that is fine, but I do use multiple Instagram pages for separate niche facets of my content. For example I have a personal page, a business page, and an art page. I would love to be able to link at least two if not all of them on my clubhouse profile if possible!

And everyone can see the reactions of each other or maybe just the speaker. \n\u25aa\ufe0fA brighter color highlighting the speaker(s) and maybe if their icon became bigger so when you want to address someone it will be easier to find them when scrolling through the room. Design feature idea: what if the stage icons were set in a circle with the speaker in the middle. Idk. Just putting that out there. \n\u25aa\ufe0fMaybe a raised hand feature when on stage to speak next. Sometimes ppl talk over each other and while mostly everyone is polite about it we forget who should speak next. Maybe a number system! for example when I am done speaking whoever raising their hand on stage after me gets the number 1, 2, 3 and so on, on their icon and they get to go next. \n\nAll in all I love the app and it helps greatly in these times.

During this game I had said something which was allowed but a individual didn\u2019t have the same view us me so they got sensitive and ended up blocking me. Unfortunately this individual happened to be friends with many of the people I associate myself with on this app so therefore when the person goes into the chat before me I am not able to join the chat. I feel the need to speak on this because I honestly find it under that someone could prevent you from enjoying a good time and gaining new information from others due to their feelings. There should be a better way to avoid these sort of problems. One can be not being able to notice the other is in the chat or even hear them speak so problems could be avoided",

It actually provides value in your life.  \n\nTo the dev team, some user notes:\n\nI have notifications enabled but banners on IOS don\u2019t give me good information.  I get a partial list of people in a room, but the banner runs out of space before I see what the room is.  A better format would be \u201c[room name]: on stage is [people names]\u201d.  As they are now, the notifications are basically useless. \n\nOn the scheduled rooms up at the top of the feed, it would be good to be able to schedule myself to listen in on the room, instead of having to remember to go back and find it again.  Then get a notification that the selected room is beginning.  \n\nIt would be good to be able to subscribe to recurring rooms, in addition to following users.  When someone creates a room, they might have the option to \u201cmake recurring\u201d and then select which recurring room it falls into.  This would allow for unique room titles, but also allow listeners to never miss a weekly/daily room they love. \n\nFinally, I\u2019d say to add an estimated duration function.

Not only am I enjoying my travel clubs (shout out to GLT!), but I am also enjoying clubs for my other interests! I\u2019m a teacher, so I\u2019m in clubs for education and science. I love languages, so I am in clubs for people learning the same languages I am! In my free time, I join social rooms and talk to random people, some have already become my friends. You can Ping people into rooms you think they would like, and they can do the same for you. Finally, I end my day by falling asleep listening to the Lullaby Club. If you have a niche interest, there might already be a club for that, or you can start your own!"

And if the room creators are only hosting for only so long then it should be timed and they can be given the option to extend the room if that time runs over. It will be able to give users the opportunity to know at what point did they enter the conversation, users will know when it will end so they can plan accordingly, and moderators don\u2019t have to explain as much. Another feature should be planning a schedule of rooms you want to enter in a queue.

The audio quality is terrible\u2014the levels of every speaker vary widely, and often change dramatically within any given session. Also the fact that you can\u2019t hear yourself when speaking is a major problem. For an app whose sole focus is audio this is unacceptable.\n\nThe ability to communicate other than actually speaking is nonexistent. It would be helpful to add some additional messaging options. And the notification options are also poor. There should be better filters to help promote rooms you only care about. The current settings don\u2019t work well at all.  \n\nOverall, there\u2019s a lot of potential with this app, but it needs much work, particularly with the awful audio."

It's a great thing but can sometimes get overwhelming. I think If there are easy access buttons for moderator such as mute all, mute multiple at once and mute rows. Second, easy access for speakers such as step down, and also a secondary raise hand button for speakers or an ability to signal to moderator something. The hand raise option is not available for speakers, but only for audience members who want to speak. That I think should extend to speakers, it will make moderating easier. We should have an availability to block/hide rooms from our home page."

Another thing, the rooms should have a chat room options for multiple reasons: 1.

If I want to enter music discussions have a that as a separate tab from sports convos or gossip talk.

Because of this problem I can\u2019t log in my account ever since I changed my phone even though I already have successfully created an account months ago. It would be much more convenient if, for example people can log in by passports or emails!",

It\u2019s disturbing to me that my photo and profile are shown to every person who has ever had my number saved in their phone. \n\nA big red flag is that you are unable to delete your profile in the app or on their website. You must first confirm your e-mail address in the app, then e-mail them and request deletion. They have stated they will take a long time to respond via e-mail. \n\nClubhouse is so invasive it is not worth downloading.",

You\u2019ll find folks go off topic and the convo evolves into a much different topic and convo than was originally stated. Some moderators bring it back to center snd stay on point. Most do not. \n\n2. Moderators usually invite their fellow friends to talk about topics. The same people seem to be in the same topics so it gets to be redundant...fast. I like others povs but these moderators not to invite new folks to speak and share. This turned me off completely. And YES, I could of started my own topic and chat to curb all this but I got turned off by the app before I even cared to do that. \n\nNet net, it\u2019s fine.

It brings a whole new experience to social media that no one knew we were lacking.... but we were.... see you on stage!!!!"

That\u2019s going to end up with more robocalls for everyone. \n\nI have made social mobile apps before and it\u2019s easy to safely invite others using apple and google\u2019s frameworks without giving up you whole contact list. \n\nIf clubhouse gets hacked or they sell their database, someone is going to get over 500 million phone numbers. This is a recipe for disaster and should be stopped immediately. (6 million users * 150 contacts per user - duplicates = ~500 million contacts total)\n\nThe contact list notification box doesn\u2019t follow apple\u2019s privacy guidelines.",

But in order to promote their network, they are engaging the worst of the influencers and wantrepreneurs\n\nThere were loads of tech issues like api errors\nAnd 503s during onboarding \n\nFinally their privacy policy is abysmal. They stole my contacts forcibly so I could invite a friend",

    "review": "I haven\u2019t used social media apps consistently much this year because I\u2019ve honestly just become bored with them, but this app is different. Instead of feeling like your wasting time when you could be doing something more productive you\u2019re actually gaining knowledge, making new friends, networking, and starting life changing relationships. Another plus is that you can meet people without the worry that they\u2019re really just bots or dealing with the image obsessed culture of other social media apps that force you to post cumbersome videos & pictures that just brainwashes society into thinking that beauty is the most important defining trait of a human beings value. Rather than far better traits like knowledge, hard work, and actual social relationships. Apps like Instagram, Twitter and Tik Tok don\u2019t have real social relationships they have \u201cfollow relationships\u201d and it\u2019s wonderful to finally see an app that\u2019s finally reversing the pathetic trends social media companies have introduced into how we think about real human interactions. \nThe one recommendation I would give to the developers is to add a functioning search feature, the app only lets you see chat rooms it\u2019s AI search ranking system thinks you\u2019ll be interested in. Unfortunately in my case this AI tends to be wrong more often than not. Beside that thank you to the people who created this amazing app, in a year where people are more isolated than ever before this app is finally doing something to bring people together.",

I know it\u2019s a live format platform but the be able to even skip back 30 seconds that would be enough. A background chat feature would be helpful if you prefer to ask questions and have them be addressed without being forced to speak. Better curation and (blocking) of certain clubs. My fee is constantly bloated very irrelevant clubs that have nothing to do with my interests. Seems fairly unintelligent. Plus I also see clubs in different languages such as Chinese, Russian, or some other Asian based language. Totally fine for people who read (and speak) this language but I only speak English and I makes no sense that Im not able to filter and limit these from showing in my feed. For some reason the Instagram account link page does not work. I log in with Facebook and it never works. I also wish these was a way to hide the person that \u201cnominated\u201d you. It\u2019s kinda weird that you are forced to display this info on your profile without the option to hide it. Finally, the app icon literally makes no sense and doesn\u2019t visually capture the branding of the actual app. Why is there some random dudes head in the icon?? Who is he?? How he it relevant to Clubhouse?? I realize standardized icons are boring but they aesthetically fit with what\u2019s already on our home screens (ex. A white stylized \u201cC\u201d on a taupe background, or even a stylized cartoon version of a\u2026.. clubhouse house \ud83c\udfe0\ud83d\udca1). I\u2019ll never understand the current icon and I hope the devs get out of their bubbles and change that because it\u2019s so stupid.",

As a commitment to opening up, we are letting folks reserve a username in advance when they download the app. \n\nHopefully this is helpful, and please let us know what we can do to redeem the experience for you.

Frustratingly, the visuals are unappealing but the content is king. New alerts have no audio alerts, in an audio only platform, don't expect people to visually pay attention.\n\n#1 feature which I think is pretty critical is whenever you're mid conversation/ thought and you hear a golden nugget that you want to replay AND you can't! \ud83d\ude21\n\n\ud83c\udf1fFeature requests\n\n1| Playback last 15 secs tappable x3  +  live button \n\n2| English only filter on alerts for \"English\" conversations only\n\n3| Visual timeline of where you are in the conversation: beginning, middle, end... We don't live in an endless realm of space time continuum without responsibilities, help us plan our schedules accordingly. I sat in a four hour chat when i thought multiple times it is ending soon\n\n4| Bookmarks (metrics): hot clubs have large audiences and there's no engagement metric of which part of a conversation listeners find are \"of value\". Allow for bookmarks that allows users to pick keynotes of the convo. This also allows for feedback back to host on what was valuable vs not. Maybe even go further and allow a 'golden mic' reward metric to measure engaged Hosts.\n\nMy App Review: \n\n\ud83d\ude4cwow, linkedin missed out. facebook missed out. These guys are geniuses. This is the platform that gets people together. Consider it the professional / hobby /enthusiast platform, similar to FB groups. Content.... is king here. When you hop into a room that resonates, it is addictive. Think podcasts meets paid specialty webinars for FREE.\n\nThe way content is consumed, it doesn't matter whether its going to be true or not anymore, probably less wiki and more time spent on \"host\" influencers. Still not sure how they\u2019re going to monetize, maybe eventually freemium model, supported by selling your interests/ data?? for now, who cares. \n\nHighly recommend using the app. Hope they grow."

    "review": "First, I love this app and I highly recommend it because wow is it packed with information. I love how easily we can connect these knowledgeable people, celebs included. So many people are active, yet it feels like I\u2019m really in...a clubhouse! Especially since it\u2019s the beta version. What was promised is delivered. While I\u2019ve not yet gotten involved in a room right as it began, whenever I do pop in, I always feel like I can get right into the tips\u2014especially from the celebrity guests. \n\u2014The background play?? NICE. I can swipe through any profile, even go to different social media platforms within the app and still listen. It\u2019s very easy to tap around and not feel like I\u2019ve messed something up. \n\u2014Love that we can search for anybody in the room or invite people. \n\n***LET\u2019S GET INTO CONS***\n\u201410 notifications an hour?? Why?? And they\u2019re just bricks of names. Super annoying and uninviting. Maybe if I\u2019m a *new* account you can send notifications in a similar fashion, so I can see the names I might like. However, 10 notifs is crazy. Especially if you don\u2019t put the name of the room I\u2019m heading into FIRST and in BOLD WITH EMOJIS. \ud83d\udc41\n\u2014Once I start following people and I turn on post notifications, wherever they will be, I should be notified with a buzzing notification. I appreciate that the other notifications are silent, but (next point) \ud83d\udde3\n\u2014I now follow about 150 people. I don\u2019t know which room nor do I have the desire to read through a list of names to see where those people will be. Take note from IG. Add a \u201cfollowing\u201d page and show me what rooms those I follow are currently involved in/what they have coming up (with the option to tap a notification bell for that specific room, of course). Again, make sure the name of the room is first and in BOLD. You can feature names in the within that post\u2014in\nBold if I follow them. Beneath the heading, and allow me the option to tap on the post to see a list of hyperlinked names of the moderators/speakers. Make sure those who I have post notifs turned on for are FIRST. \ud83d\udccc \n\u2014Can you have a feature where you save the session for 24 hours or is it just for live viewers?\n\u2014Can the rooms be regulated? One mod said something like, \u201cwe\u2019ve been hosting for over 10 hours! \ud83d\ude04\u201d I don\u2019t know if she meant that the one room had been going on for that long or what, but it would be nice to get a sense of not only what I\u2019ll be listening to, but for how long it goes on. \n\u2014Please add an applause feature, and a hand-raising feature for the speakers. Maybe add a feature where we can gift things app-only gifts to members. Like badges? Maybe I\u2019m getting ahead of myself there. \ud83c\udfc5 \n\u2014When the speakers want to add something, make their circles squares or stars or something and change the color so I can see them. \n\u2014Make it clearer what section I\u2019m looking at. Have drop-down menus showing me where the audience is, the mods, etc. \ud83d\udcc3 \n\u2014Add a chat feature, maybe. I\u2019d love to be able to ask people in a chat room about what the person just said. But I don\u2019t see a chat feature at any time. A chat feature could always start out open at the bottom half of the screen with an option to close it. Everyone would have the option to use the chat, except the speakers and mods have names in bold, badges, custom lettering, etc. As well, give the option to tap the name of an audience member\u2019s chat to @ and respond to them. Then again, this feature could backfire. Idk. \ud83e\udd14\n\u2014The speakers say to DM them, but should we not be allowed to DM them here? I understand it could be exhausting trying to answer DMs from a bunch of platforms, but how do we directly contact them as clubhouse members as opposed to just \u201cfans\u201d?\n\u2014The layout makes me dizzy.\ud83e\udd22 It just feels like a bunch of stuff everywhere. No clear lines of demarcation. \n\u2014Maybe utilize \u201cflyers\u201d that are more visual rather than always a wall of text to call attention to upcoming rooms. \n\nThat\u2019s all for now. Thank you guys for creating/hosting such an innovative club! \ud83d\ude04",

Instead of people hiding behind fashion choices, fabulous backgrounds or makeup trends, you get to FOCUS on the what makes people unique- their point of view. You can SEE through viewpoint as they explain why they feel the way they do or how they came to a certain conclusion.  \n\nThe iPhone is the optimal device to be able to listen to different tones, pitch, timber, etc due to it\u2019s superior audio quality, hence why reality shows always use iPhone for speakerphone scenes. And this is crucial to literally BE with other people.. hearing their full humanity projected over wifi. People are raw, honest and yet somehow respectful. You can HEAR people pausing, gasping, crying, laughing, thinking, searching for words or the meaning of life.. all in REAL time. And we have the opportunity to LISTEN. \n\nUnfortunately, The ISSUE is RACE. While Clubhouse aims to be and remain a safe space for everyone, some feel as though Black people are not welcomed, and some of the statements made by some users are dismissive and indicate a level of awareness that should have been achieve post #GeorgeFloyd \n\nSo there needs to be more of a balance regarding creating a safe space and tools for moderators to ensure people are not traumatized or triggered while using the app. It\u2019s a glorious, life changing and addictive odyssey, but with all things human- is isn\u2019t perfect. I\u2019m willing to dive DEEP into the issues and create solutions on \u201croom\u201d on clubhouse filled with curious, open, respectful, mindful, well intended people at a time.",

It didn\u2019t give me the option to allow microphone usage only when in app, so I decided to only turn on the microphone when I wanted to talk.\n\nThat being said, I noticed today that there is no option to choose microphone settings anymore. One is locked in and does not have option to choose how the app uses one\u2019s microphone. \n\nUsers need the option to decide when the microphone is being used. Yes sure, a lot of people are signing up now and may overlook this feature, because this is a voice chat app, but it is questionable that there are no options to change the microphone settings to allow only in-app, or to set them at all.\n\nIt\u2019s becoming easier to jump in on this platform, so it can be easy to overlook this stuff with all the hype of getting in. Giving permission for someone to have your address book feels like a small price to pay in order to \u201clet more people in,\u201d but a  in practice. It\u2019s already questionable how the idea of exclusivity makes the possibility of joining more elusive and exciting...I\u2019ve definitely fallen for it. \n\nI really want to be able to use this app- feels like a cool way to connect with folks. Please give us the option to change the settings. \n\nPeople are excited to get in, but let\u2019s chill out and not download the app until Clubhouse is transparent and committed to allowing users to customize the microphone settings.",

When viewing the \u201cUpcoming Events\u201d on the main calendar page, you\u2019re likely to see dozens of events. Sometimes I just want to see upcoming events for a particular club. \n\nAlso, while in a live room it can be difficult to see which member is speaking. Maybe they can change that highlighted gray border of the speaker to a more noticeable color or shade border. (03.13.2021)",

The developers show up every single week to make sure to get feedback from the users and are continuously making improvements.\n\nThe best part is how they have their no policy trolls, bully, overall mean people set up. This is invite only so who ever invite someone to the app is also responsible for that person, meaning,If someone is being a bully, troll were using hate speech then they are reported and if the developer said that they are banned from this app as well as the person who gave them the invite.\n\nAnd guess what, invites are earned by how much you give to the app and the communities there.\n\nPeople are showing up who are brilliant brilliant human beings that we literally get to have conversations with.\n\nImagine having access to a speaking engagement for free from your home with some of the greatest minds out there and the ability to ask them questions for free.\n\nThis app is for people who give their time and don\u2019t ask for anything in return because they want to collectively serve the community as a human race.\n\nThis app has restored my faith in humanity as I can hear and connect with people that are athletic and genuine.\n\nAre there opportunities for fun? Comedy? Shark Tank pitch rooms? Finding Capital and being an angel investor account? Discussing mental health topics? Support for mothers, men, couples, Artist, physicians, dentists, coaches, speakers, Podcasters, music engineer, music artist, yes. That is what I haveAt the top of my mind.\n\nCould this be great for business opportunities? Absolutely, but of course if you know so good and marketers ruin everything LOL but there is a classy way to do things after you\u2019ve net worth and connecting with people.\n\nIf you have an iPhone download this app and hopefully your friend in your contact list and you can see for yourself.\n\nAnd because I\u2019m here Typing out this review, I might as well let you all know that you can find my clubs \u201cself care curators\u201d  and \u201c conscious couples quote from JennyAHansen.\n\nIf you find me from this review please message me and let me know because that would add a whole new level of cool to this entire community and apps abilities.\n\nLots of love! Have a beautiful and amazing day.\n\nJennyAHansen"

This kind of puts you in a space of responsibility for the people that you invite. Which means, at least I hope, that there won\u2019t be many trolls on this platform. My only challenge is that I\u2019ve been on for about four days now and in a group for new users, they say we can create our own clubs and suggested we should do so within our first seven days. They explained that there was a new update that allowed for us to create a new club and that we could use it by going down to the clubs that were a member of and clicking the plus symbol and then proceeding to create that new club. There was an issue with that and one member was told that they should uninstall the app and then reinstall it and that should get them the most recent update which was yesterday. I did that exact thing, and found that high am not able to make a club. The messaging states that I have to be one of the top users to make a club. So that was disappointing. I can, however, create a room. I think the rooms you create disappear when you leave them. I am excited to learn more and would definitely give 5 stars if I could make a club."

As a user, I\u2019m furious about leaving a trail of all the rooms I hopped in and at which time. This is equivalent to sharing my google and YouTube search history, what I read on the internet and how much time I spend on social media channels. No one wants their followers to know all this. At first this app was cool since we can connect with new people around the world, but now with family members, professors, close friends and coworkers following me, I have to be cautious about when and what rooms I join. This will result in less engagement on the app. Their recent new feature on reporting trolls is interesting; I understand their intentions are good but they haven\u2019t thought it through. People are abusing it to knock off their competition and getting 4-5 friends to report the same person. This takes the \u201ctroll\u2019s\u201d voice away, when they weren\u2019t even trolling in the first place.

I\u2019d love to send an invite to another friend who could use it but I don\u2019t have any more. It would have been helpful for the app to give me a heads up or even for the invite to bounce back or something. Also, it appears that some people received 5 invites and some received less so I\u2019m not sure what the reason is for why there\u2019s a disparity in how the invites are allocated.",
