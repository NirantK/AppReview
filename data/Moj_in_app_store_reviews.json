Videos do pause automatically after spending sometime surfing through videos in video feed.\n\n3. When we go to a creator's page, open a video and then scroll to move to next, videos don't get aligned properly on screen. \n\n4. Provide an option to become a beta tester through app.\n\n5. \"Comments\" option was not really needed. I liked it's absence. But would love to see a \"dislike\" button.\n\n6. Day mode and dark mode both should be there. My iPhone is set to turn to one of these modes depending upon sunrise and sunset. Would be great if your app follows it too.\n\n6. Last but not the least, I hope you have a control and plans to avoid spreading cringe content. Also focus on not spreading only big creator's videos who were famous on Tik Tok. People didn't really like them.",

After all I really appreciate the initiative for the development of this app.\n\n1)I\u2019m not able to see the notifications on my profile nor the likes are getting displayed there\n\n2) When we are looking at the newsfeed theres a problem in that, and it feels so inefficient in which we are unable to check who liked our videos or who shared it. \n\n3) The page doesn\u2019t get refresh when there\u2019s a problem raises \n\n4) Its response is very slow and late.",
