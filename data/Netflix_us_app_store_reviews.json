    "review": "Please remove audio description feature by default or remember audio description setting from one movie or episode to the next. I use the audio description feature sometimes to hear how a screenplay of a particular scene would be written because of my interest in screenwriting. When the scene is over, I turn it audio description settings off because it gets annoying quickly. However, I\u2019ve notice this feature has been turned on by default recently in the iOS app. I haven\u2019t really noticed if it\u2019s the same with the tvOs or website. I tried to turn the settings off and it worked but when the current (now playing) episode or movie ends, when the next episode or movie starts, the audio description feature turns back on. I had to turn it off for every episode each time. It was really frustrating at the point I had to paused the show and write this review. Honestly, this is not really a review. I hoping your development team would consider this at a bug report. It is annoying that audio description is turn on by default and you can\u2019t turn it off permanently for future movies or episodes. Please fix. \ud83d\ude21"

    "review": "Netflix is a GREAT app, I\u2019ve probably been using it for 8 years or so. Over the past years, Netflix has expanded its operations greatly, and made viewing videos more accessible than ever. However, I feel that the privacy of the app should be increased much more. Whenever I\u2019m watching a tv show, sometimes other members of my family try to log on and watch the SAME EXACT show on the same profile while I\u2019m trying to watch. putting a lock on the profiles would be much better for people who want to keep their viewing private and out of the hands of people who share the account. Another issue I have is that sometimes, I\u2019ll watch the first few minutes of a show, and I\u2019ll end up stopping because the show is bad. removing shows out of currently watching is one of the most annoying issues this app has never fixed. I have maybe 10 shows and movies I\u2019m watching, and scrolling through a bunch of more shows that I ended up never watching trying to find what I want to see is a big pain. Lastly, Netflix is getting really outdated. Watching classics is becoming a pain on Netflix, and the newest shows and movies are never updated. After getting a YT Tv subscription, I was able to find more complete, fuller versions of my favorite movie franchises and tv shows. Netflix needs to start upgrading its viewer base, or what Netflix became famous for-being able to watch the best shows easily-is going to be erased. \n\nwritten by a teenager."

    "review": "This is actually about something about Netflix being on tv. Let us review our downloads when we don\u2019t have internet. Idk if they/y\u2019all do this because of money wise but yeah. Either way i just think that should be a thing. Also. We should be able to download interactive videos...idk why we need internet to play period. It\u2019s not like you can meet others that are also playing the game\ud83d\ude44 the app is good generally I guess.. And one more thing. I know that a lot of shows are made by NETFLIX and there\u2019s three things I need to say. One \u261d\ufe0f: stop making really stupid stuff often. I have a little sis and me and her just can\u2019t help but make fun of some of the shows because they were for like 3-5 years Old and she\u2019s 7 turning eight very soon. Two : make an teen section. A lot of the adult movies/shows are very VERY inappropriate and/or uncomfortable, they shouldn\u2019t need to be inappropriate just because it\u2019s for adults. Three: this isn\u2019t to important but if you know what I\u2019m talking about. It\u2019s the profile pics. I was setting mine and my sis came and wanted my pic but since hers is only kids it doesn\u2019t show the shows that aren\u2019t for kids, HECK some of the shows aren\u2019t even that bad. So what I\u2019m saying is they should allow characters faces on ur own profile even if there from a adult show. Anyways if Netflix actually cares maybe they would add at least one thing one the app. \ud83d\ude10"

    "review": "Alright, Netflix is awesome! It\u2019s so easy to stream movies, TV shows, interactive games, and more all accessible through Netflix! The only thing that I could think of to improve this app is another section. So far there is kids and adult. But what about teens like me? Kids has a TON of cartoons and kiddy shows. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love cartoons as much as the next person, I just want something a bit more adventurous. The adult version has a wide variety of movies, but a lot of them are inappropriate for teens like me. If you could add a teen version, where the more appropriate movies are, that would be lovely! The movies, (no matter the rating) should be good for young audiences. This means the movies should be rated for cussing. None of the movies should have naughty things. (passionate hugging/kissing, and you know, anything that's an inappropriate display of affection) but some cussing could be allowed since in college and high school, there aren't many child-friendly peers there sadly. Another suggestion would be to (forgive me if you already have this) add a feature (free or not, your choice) where if you're watching a movie and leave the app, you can still see a small box of the screen in the corner. The box should be moveable, this way you can surf the sea of neverending emails while binging your favorite show on the wonderful app, Netflix."

Everything works beautifully and it\u2019s easy to search for what you\u2019re looking for and the list of saved shows is fine too. My big issue, however, is with the currently watching area on the tv app, phone app, and website. Sure there are tons (and I mean TONS) of articles all over the web giving instructions on how to remove shows from the currently watching section that you no longer want to view, but Netflix it\u2019s your job to provide an easier method for doing this. It\u2019s unrealistic to expect people to go into their history and delete a millions episodes of a show just to get to the movies and whatever other shows they need to remove from that section. Just allow a space on the titles to remove them from that area. Especially for shows or movies that you try out and end up not liking. They stay there for months! Also, the app on tv plays the show or movie just when you\u2019re trying to read the info about it and guess what?? That also adds that title to currently watching! Fix this issue please! It\u2019s 2020! We shouldn\u2019t have to google the hundreds of articles teaching people how to get around your archaic ways with this one thing. Do better, Netflix."

The app is significantly easy to use, and my favorite part is their always adding more!! It\u2019s really easy to find things that your interested in because the app takes what you have watched, and recommends similar options. Most Netflix originals are also genuinely very good!\n\nI do have two suggestions for somethings that could be implemented in the future. My  first idea is that you could be able to follow other people. This way you could find out what your friends, family, or anyone else you know, is watching/interested in. You could find lots of great shows that you didn\u2019t know about or watch before. My second thing is something that has been mentioned in other reviews, and that is an actual, legitimate teen section. And i\u2019m not talking tv-7. I\u2019m  talking quality shows, PG13/TV14, stuff like that. I think both of these ideas could help improve Netflix in the future.\n\nThat\u2019s all I have! Overall, Netflix is a wonderful app, full of great selection, amazing viewing quality, and awesome shows, movies, documentaries, you name it"

    "review": "I noticed over the past year that I have been using Netflix less and have been really disappointed with their selection and layout. So I downgraded to the lowest possible billing option and have been great with it for months now. Layout: I wish that when I selected which genre I want to watch that it showed a years list. I like 90's suspense thrillers and kids holiday movies, 50's creature feature horror movies, and 80's action and comedy movies. But it's a bit hard to find with their made up titled sections and makes me waste more time searching than watching. And the search feature doesn't not show me all the movies in these keywords as only a few can fit on the search screen. Also, there movie selection in these categories aren't that much and I end up watching Crackle a lot more. Ended up watching Crackle and Freeform Channel for Halloween instead! I feel Netflix has too much Drama and Gore movies-not my cup of tea. I expected new seasons of \"Sabrina the teenage witch,\" \"Mystery Science Theater,\" and other such shows to be new and available for October but they were not. So knowing when to show new show seasons for holidays is lacking. Who needs the new \"Nutcracker\" movie in July!? Also, when am I going to see new \"Mystery Science Theater\" episodes? Love the new show!! Creature feature movies are really lacking on Netflix!! And when is the new \"Bright\" movie coming out!? This is why I downgraded."

    "review": "Dear Netflix,\n\nI love Netflix SO much but, I do think it needs some work. First, I think there should be a teen section. The kid section is too immature for teens while some of the things in the adult section are too mature. The PG-13 and PG-14 content should be in its own section. There are also some titles that are rated TV-MA that also don\u2019t feature much inappropriate content that could be in the teens section. I think the teen section can feature cursing, kissing, and violence but no nudity. Second, I think you should be able to lock your profile because kids can enter the adults section very easily and watch something inappropriate. Also if you share your Netflix account with other people they can enter your account and watch shows which will then give you show recommendations that you aren\u2019t interested in or mess up the shows your watching. Third, I think you should be able to delete shows you watched but didn\u2019t like from your Continue Watching because then a long list of TV shows and movies will line up and I think you should be able to do it from ALL devices. Fourth, I think shows shouldn\u2019t be removed as often as they are and more shows should be added to the kids section since, its not updated as frequently as the adults section."

    "review": "I think Netflix is really great. There are so many good shows and movies to choose from. It has really great service and there is almost never any lag. I do have questions about your rating system though. There is this one show called Demon slayer and on Netflix it is rated PG-14 but whenever I look it up everywhere else says it\u2019s rated MA, and then there\u2019s another show called Blue Exorcist and it\u2019s rated MA on both Netflix and everywhere else, but there is actually little to no profanity in it and it\u2019s actually less gory than shows like Demon Slayer. So what I\u2019m getting to is your rating system seems broken, since it\u2019s obvious your allowed to choose the rating of the shows on Netflix depending on what you see fit. It would also be nice if you went and reviewed some of the shows more closely and rated them better because what you call gory enough to be MA in one show is appropriate in another. And it would be really great if there was a teens option where you could put movies that are rated PG-13 or 14 since a lot of the shows in the kid\u2019s section are for really little kids and when you\u2019re on adults then you have access to some really inappropriate content."

And one of the biggest actions Netflix did to prove my point is making the ridiculous and obvious mistake of getting rid of the 5 star review system which helped fine tune which movies were recommended for us. Some of us like my entire family for example had each perfectly fine tuned the movie recommendation algorithm after working hard to submit honest ratings for every single Netflix streaming movie we'd watched for multiple years (since Netflix first started offering its streaming service). And then without even asking for its customers opinion on the matter it just gets rid of the entire rating system and implements the useless thumps up or down rating! If Netflix ends up falling from the heights it's reached it will only be because of their lack of common curtesy and respect towards its customers feedback."

One can argue logging in via laptop/computer could be less secure. Especially if the web browser saves passwords and I am a user who never logs out on a computer that never locks.

My most favorite show on the app is Green Eggs and Ham, for it is pure genius, and this is where I tell you about the one little problem in here. So, a year ago, somewhere in November of 2020 that is, Netflix was supposed to have the second season of Green Eggs and Ham available to watch on. But for some reason, it did not release, which was pretty disappointing. But then, this year, it was announced that the second season will premiere on Netflix on February 2nd. I found all this info on Google, probably before that day. So yeah, on that day, I went to Netflix to start watching it, but I found no second season of that show. As soon as I saw this, I was very disappointed, but then I thought, maybe it will still come the next day, which I did wait for. But the next day, the second season was still not there. And now it has been nearly a week since this has happened, and it is still not available yet. I know you are all probably pretty busy at the moment, but could you please have season 2 of Green Eggs and Ham on your app as soon as possible? Thank you!"

Anyways my idea that I wanted to send to Netflix is how I think instead of having 3 seasons of the show I was just talking about they would turn the comic books into episodes so people like me who don\u2019t like to read even if there is pictures will still be able to enjoy the series. I mean we still are paying our monthly fee so you won\u2019t have a problem with money and it will make a  lot of people happy like just ask people who like and watched Avatar the last Airbender and they will say they would have rather had a lot more seasons of said show than Legends of Korra even though I would still like to keep \ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffbthis show.

At first i thought it had gotten taken off netflix, but soon after I found it it had gotten moved to the TV MA section which made zero sense to me. These show have been rated differently and the only one the rating makes sense for are jojos bizarre adventure but the other ones I listed aren\u2019t meant for ONLY adults. I enjoyed and was about to start watching some of these shows until netflix took them off the teen section and im not allowed to go to the adult section. I want my shows back and im hoping netflix will realize that these shows dont belong on only the adult section, but also for teens. I turn to netflix whenever I want to watch an anime without ads but if they keep moving them to age groups that dont make sense, I might as well stick to crunchyroll and funimation. Please put the shows back so that I can enjoy this app and the content that is on it."

There might be some new karate lovers that love each other. Let\u2019s go to season 3, Tori and Robbie had a little bit of time spent together. They started getting a little buddy-buddy if you know what I mean;). So in season 4, they might hit it off a bit. Like it was Sam and Miguel, then Sam and Robbie while Miguel and tori also, so why not throw in a little Tori and Robbie together in the dish. So it is pretty clear that Robbie and Tori have to get together at some point of the Cobra Kai timeline. So Netflix, I really hope you read my last review tho. I spend a lot of time on these so I hope people like my reviews. Also people are saying that Hawk\u2019s hair will be orange but, for some reason I think his hair will be green, I saw it in my head and thought that it would be SICK!

It wasn\u2019t great, but the app with older apple tvs was better at inputting passcode even before the added step. \n Why with the TVOS app can I not always see all of the description of a specific episode or movie including language spoken when scrolling through episodes. I like scrolling through episodes current way better then old way where i didnt even know what season I looking at unless i scrolled to top. Just allow ability to get all the info. Put back a way to better exclude things on main menu I will never watch. For example I only like stand up comedy in a club with a group of people watching together live I will never watch stand up comedy on Netflix so please quit showing them to me. Others may love them. Make it easier for both of us.  I have tried to give thumbs down over and over. You used to be better at putting shows in menu I may want to watch without searching or being hidden by a ton of stuff i will never watch. \n\n Non-app issue. Quality Content has been lacking."

    "review": "This review is mainly about Netflix original series. Most of them are really good! They have cool ideas for shows and spare no expense getting some of the best in Hollywood. The problem is Netflix puts out too many too fast. Viewers can not keep up so shows might not get watched for years after they were created. Therefore Netflix doesn\u2019t get the feedback fast enough about what viewers like and dislike. Shows that are really good end up getting canceled and shows that are not good continue. No one likes getting hooked on a show, watching a few seasons, then it just ends with no explanation only to find out it was canceled last year! Example...Santa Clarita Diet. Great show with the perfect cast. Invested 3 seasons to find out Netflix canceled it almost 1 year ago. Just seems like if Netflix focused more on quality instead of quantity when it comes to their originals, viewers would have a much better experience. Other than that, Netflix is awesome. But, you don\u2019t want to disappoint viewers or waste $ on shows being canceled or never taking off when viewers have a lot more options these days.",

But I don\u2019t like when they took off Geronimo Stilton  was my favorite thing to watch on Netflix. Please bring it back to Netflix. Anyways if anyone didn\u2019t like Netflix then you should get it together. Because Netflix is amazing \ud83d\ude09 \ud83d\ude09I have one suggestion for you guys maybe you could put all the shows on Netflix and make something called Netflix world kind of like Disney world. Also you could make an app called Netflix games for an example a Good Burger make a game were you are Ed and you get to choose your own silly thing to do. And  then in the app you create your own Good burger. You choose all the characters. Then you can send them to Netflix and you can watch them. And you do that for all the things on Netflix! I know I\u2019m being annoying but please please answer one of those suggestions.

    "review": "Most of the time, I find Netflix to be a thoroughly enjoyable app largely free of bugs and other potential annoyances. However, I recently found myself without a reliable wi-fi connection, which obliged me to stream over my LTE data connection. Much to my exasperation, I discovered that Netflix has taken the patronizing approach of disabling autoplay when streaming via cellular data. I thought at first that this irritation might be remedied by a quick trip to my account page, where the playback settings are found. However, there is just one autoplay-related checkbox, which was checked. A call to customer service confirmed that autoplay is unavailable over cellular. I feel that this policy is frankly ridiculous. With the profusion of unlimited data plans on the market, one should at least be given the option of whether to disable autoplay over data rather than have Netflix unilaterally decide the matter. I am perfectly capable of monitoring my own cellular data use; I do not need Netflix or any other company to hold my hand and choose whether I get to use cellular data. When this nonsense is resolved, I will happily add some stars to my rating; until then, there should be a price for condescension.",

It could also give Netflix an easier way to figure out what shows to keep and what shows to take off. It can also give a better idea of what new shows to put on based on what people like. \nThere have been so many times that I\u2019ve seen an episode or a scene of a show or movie, and I wanted to scroll down to the comments to see what other people had to say. (Oh if you were to do this, it would probably be best to do a separate comment section for each episode of a show so that people don\u2019t get spoilers)\nPutting a comment section on the shows can even help to connect Netflix users. They can interact and bond over their love for a show. They can laugh over a funny scene. Or a number of other things.\nAll in all, I love Netflix but I think it\u2019d be pretty cool to add a comment section",

When I started years ago you had like 8 pages of every genre and what we liked & disliked, you numbered our watchlists so we were aware of how many we were adding there. It was a very simple method to move items from say 352 to number 4, there was a rating of 1 to 5, showing what most people liked and what we liked. All of these things have been removed and it wasn\u2019t for our benefit. Every update has major flaws just updated my app on my iPad to find my watchlist on my fire tv still had 352 items in it. Luckily I don\u2019t ever update that one and on the iPad after the update it shows I have 76. When you try to change the order in your list, it can only be done from a computer and once again 1/2 of my watchlist is missing. Now making that impossible to do. Keep making bad choices and not listening to your customers and you will find you are no longer getting more customers, in fact you might start to see a lot of your very loyal customers paying for maybe 3 months a year instead of paying every month for 6 or more years.

    "review": "I avoid searching for shows on Netflix because I hate this insistence on showing parts of the movie or show when you're trying to read what it's about or are just scanning through a category. If I know what I'm going to watch, I go straight to it, and the original and international content is unmatched. But I despise being force-fed trailers and previews on any TV service, showing you before you watch what you're about to watch, and getting it in hacked up bits that reveal a lot of the best moments. And Netflix is by far the worst. So much for being surprised, thrilled and delighted by unanticipated events. A lot of us watch for the surprises and the fun in trying to guess what's coming next. Hey, Netflix, we're already on your service and intent on watching your TV and movie shows. You've got to understand that subtlety has great virtue and we're smart enough to figure out what we want to try without being shoveled bits like dummies. Besides, we also know that trailers are extensively edited, of course, and intended to show off only the best action and character lines. What we see, especially the lightening pacing and exaggerated action, is often not what we get. The previews don't reflect the quality of a production and may turn us off to things we'd otherwise try.",

Some examples like F.r.i.e.n.d.s, Coraline, Suicide Squad, and Beauty and the Beast. Those are only a few. The newer shows snd movies y\u2019all are adding just don\u2019t catch my attention. Im sure other people agree with me as well. Also, some of the shows that y\u2019all have, don\u2019t have all the seasons. That just bothers me so much because I think it only has that amount of seasons, but it turns out that it doesn\u2019t. So I just watched that show for no reason, and sometimes I really, really, really like the show and can\u2019t seem to find it anywhere else in order to watch it. I really hope y\u2019all consider putting some older shows/movies that were on Netflix back, or consider trying to put more seasons or all the seasons on the shows, and finally, consider putting some other shows on like Law and Order. That\u2019s really the only one.

I am loving the fact that new movies during COVID are being released here, and it\u2019s the first place I check for movie nights. The only thing I wish to add is a place in my account settings to add my preferences of things I do not wish to be recommended. I will never wish to see a crime show - I understand for many it\u2019s a hit and is always recommended on my home page. I just wish it wouldn\u2019t show up on my home page as I know that\u2019s one genre I won\u2019t be open to no matter how popular. If I could simply add to my settings which genre and how often I would like to see it, I think it would make for a much better experience. Isn\u2019t that exactly the goal Netflix aims for? Curating the exact type of shows a person aims to watch based on their past views? I hope someone in the Netflix team sees this and gives us a full opportunity to create preferences that truly reflect our ideal entertainment preferences. Thank you! :)",

And then also with a 9-13 year old section that means in the kids section there won\u2019t be stuff like not inappropriate but like just a little to old for kids like 8 and under . And there should also be a young adult section so like for adults that are 18-28 so like not tv ma rated things on there. I personally think that tv ma means only ages 30 and up are aloud to watch not even super responsible people so tv ma shouldn\u2019t be on any section younger than adult. And I say this because I\u2019m a tween and I get a little mad when it says for you and there\u2019s a bunch of kids shows . And also there should be a section for like 40-60 so a little to old to have kids and in to elderly. And a section for elders so ages 60 and up.

    "review": "Used to be our go-to app for streaming even though we subscribed to others.  Content was great, navigation was intuitive, and the app worked exceptionally well.  Unfortunately all of the above has changed. We rarely watch it. The content has taken a real dive in quality. Fewer quality movies, too much reality tv trash, and too much low quality foreign programming (the better quality stuff is on a different streaming service).  There used to be a rating system in the app that affected the kinds of shows that show up in your queue. Really miss that.  And the navigation changes are terrible. Talk about fixing something that wasn\u2019t broken!!  The search tool and other functions were moved to a sidebar - as if someone said \u201clet\u2019s copy the worst elements of browser design and slap it on our app.\u201d  And the annoying \u201cstill watching?\u201d window that interrupts streaming should have an adjustable setting - especially after the new April 2019 rate hike.  It will make Netflix the most expensive service we stream.  Luckily there\u2019s growing competition in the streaming space, and 2019 is going to be a good year for new streaming services.  Of the 4 streaming apps we subscribe to this one is securely in 3rd place and falling.",

When someone else is watching the  the same show and he or she goes to a different episode. That  I was not on it go\u2019s to my iPad. I was thinking maybe they were going on my account but then they told me they didn\u2019t so hella confused\ud83d\ude2f\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd14. And sometimes when I have headphones it will turn up the sound and I want to see if it works on any other app no it does not\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\udc4c. But there is a bright side it will let me download videos like if someone\u2019s driving and I\u2019m in the car going to my aunts that is in Massachusetts I could watch my videos with no Wi-Fi. But then the bright side Kinda turns into a dark-ish side\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude15. Someone would download way too much episodes and hide it then I can\u2019t delete it. I will try downloading one of my videos then he will tell me  \ud83e\udd74there was too much videos downloaded delete some videos\ud83e\udd74 like seriously \ud83d\ude12 well that\u2019s my review bye!"

    "review": "Before all the Netflix Originals were  replacing good and more older shows it was a great app. It had many throwback shows that I still love to this day and it was in general a great app for me. Now they are taking off shows with no warning. I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer, when it was on Netflix, and I was really into it. Then I was on Snapchat and I had to find out from there that it was going to get taken off of the app. Why can\u2019t they have a section for the shows they are going to take off, so we can at least know if a show we were going to watch is getting taken off and watch it quickly. And I\u2019m very disappointed that they took off many of the older tv shows that were around when I was younger because now I have no where to watch them. Netflix is the only app I can use to watch shows, but now I have to either rewatch shows that are on there or watch Netflix originals that are a season long, on average, and have 10 20 minute episodes. WHY WOULD YOU REPLACE A SHOW THAT HAD MORE CONTENT FOR A SHOW THAT HAS 1 SEASON AND TAKES A YEAR TO PRODUCE ANOTHER ONE THAT IS JUST AS SHORT!"

    "review": "Netflix is one of my favorite tv providers, first to a few others. From Stranger Things to bird box, it has amazing things on it. Also, if there is a movie out in theaters that would normally cost like 30 dollars to rent, especially if it just came out, all I have to do is wait and most likely it will pop up on Netflix! And even better is after I Finnish watching that I can watch a whole bunch of other things instead of being sad that it is over. I highly recommend Netflix, it\u2019s amazing especially for the price. The price does go up over time, but I don\u2019t mind, as long as I can still watch Stranger Things XD! Thank you for reading this. Oh and by the way, the only bad thing kinda bad I have to say is, why do you remove such good shows?  You may have a really good show on, then like a month or two later I can\u2019t watch it crii. So instead of removing things just bring the price up a little or something... but still, I will always and never won\u2019t be a true Netflix fan. \ud83d\ude01"

I am a young viewer, so Netflix has child appropriate thing for kids to watch that will help with their health.

I can even type in the tittle in the search web so I don\u2019t have to keep on browsing and browsing and browsing to find the best thing to watch! Netflix also is sooooooo entertaining! It\u2019s just like... EVERYTHING!! I don\u2019t know why this isn\u2019t a five star, it should at least get a five and a half! Y\u2019all Netflix haters, just delete Netflix and let\u2019s see how entertain you can keep yourself on some boring days where you have nothing to do. You\u2019ll regret being like \u201cOmg!

I was surprise to find these since I done plenty of search before and never came across them, but most importantly I was so excited to watch them. I wasn\u2019t made aware that when I cross the border they would be gone from my device. It\u2019s almost a shame I was starting to love Netflix but finding out that what I want to watch differs from country too country it\u2019s not worth the price I\u2019m paying since I run the risk of going to another country where if I choose to take my list of Netflix to watch over there in my spare time I run the risk of my show or movie disappearing from my device. The whole \u201cit\u2019s about location, popularity, and purchasing rights.\u201d Shouldn\u2019t fall under what people are paying in order to watch what they want, people are unique and they watch different shows, I thought the viewer was more important than the location and the popularity of a specific show or movie."

EASILY.. the best and biggest selection for a cheap price. I dig the multiple profiles not just 2 or 3(new animations are cool and fresh btw). Even big families like my own can enjoy and have their own shows and movies the kids and adults would like to watch. The app is so easy a toddler can navigate to their favorite children shows. Thanks for Stranger Things, for adding the new Transformer film and the constant flow of Marvel blockbusters.. on top of having the Flash and Arrow among other DC comics television shows. Although I would ask that the team work on list alerts on when a show or movie will be removed soon.. especially when we have it on our list. I get disappointed when I plan to watch something and when I remember to, I\u2019m too late as it has been removed from Netflix. Other than that, I believe this app is perfect."

    "review": "Netflix is great-for the most part, but there are some things it needs to work on... a.) It needs a \u2018Forward 10 seconds (or 20) as well as having the \u2018rewind 10 seconds\u2019 button in the iOS app. Many times I switch from TV to my iPhone, & for whatever reason, it hasn\u2019t caught up to where I left off on the TV. I\u2019d like to be able to hit a \u2018skip 20 seconds\u2019 button so I can get to exactly where I left off (the scroller is just too small & inaccurate..). b.) The fact that Netflix discontinues shows/movies is a big negative. I hear this complaint - a LOT. Netflix, if you\u2019re going to continue raising your prices, you need to keep shows on either INDEFINITELY (especially POPULAR shows), or give us a clear warning as to WHEN IT WILL BE LOST! This is a BIG pain. In he iPhone app, you don\u2019t have that. c.) I agree with other users\u2019 complaints that you need to stop the automatic (loud) content ads, or give us the option to turn the audio OFF on them. Who needs that?  Every scroll to another show creates a new blaring ad for the show I\u2019ve accidentally scrolled to. Please stop.. Other than that... etc."

And this only happens on my phone when I watch it on my tv it\u2019s perfectly fine. I am not sure if it\u2019s just my phone but it just doesn\u2019t make sense that it only happens to Netflix original shows and it\u2019s super annoying especially because are usually watch them on my phone and not the TV because it\u2019s more convenient but it will always freeze and I have to skip it or restart every time and when it freezes it will freeze about four times in one episode"

The new feature where Netflix begins auto playing a show if you hover above it on home screen  for 3 seconds while trying to browse (on various applications such as Roku) has destroyed the experience. It creates \u201cnoise\u201d literally and figuratively and weird urgency. Many want to browse, actually peruse and think. The auto preview feature creates a rushed and intrusive experience. Muting is only option but so distracting. Clearly they aren\u2019t listening to customers because similar posts are all over web (including the fact many may have children in room while scrolling and some of noise/violence is unexpected. Ruining the integrated Netflix experience between apps. No setting at all to disable and *no this isn\u2019t same as auto play or auto preview at END of watching show* but is part of home screen experience. No other complaints about Netflix, at all."

It really helped me decide what was worth watching, now we just have a like or dislike system where it can\u2019t see other viewers opinions about it, so it\u2019s pointless for the viewers. Second, I get the Netflix originals are meant to tempt people to get Netflix for certain shows, but they need quality over quantity. Nobody cares about how ever many shows or movies that are originals, people care a lot more about a few movies and shows that are really good and have a large following. Lastly, this kind of goes with the second one, but we need more original movies and shows that everybody knows and loves. For example, Polar Express, I Am Legend, Spongebob, and many others I can\u2019t think of right now. Hopefully these actually get read and these suggestions might eventually get passed on, though I have my doubts, but it\u2019s worth a shot. Anyways, good app and I recommend getting"

And if you got an answer for this which I am pretty sure you won\u2019t cover I am wondering why there are so many comments with very very bad reviews why you haven\u2019t fixed any of it, you have all the time in the world now so I just wonder why you don\u2019t bring back old shows that people want to rewatch and relive desperately but you decide that shows like oh I don\u2019t know the one I\u2019ve written three reviews about the haunting hour that was an incredible show me and my cousin and some of my friends loved watching it but you didn\u2019t bring that back in the matter how many reviews I wrote why, I don\u2019t know but there are so many reviews that you don\u2019t seem to read about bringing back old shows you rarely do that and some people have been deleting your app because it\u2019s lost it\u2019s charm and doesn\u2019t provide actually good shows anymore"

    "review": "so I know a lot of teens also want this and I\u2019m hoping you listen to us. There is a kids and adult section. the adult section would be great except there\u2019s a lot of inappropriate stuff and some people have strict parents that make them use the kid section... which is absolutely terrible. There\u2019s tons of stupid little kidy cartoons that I don\u2019t wanna watch. I\u2019m fine with the kid sitcoms but like you need to make a teen section with the kid sitcoms and teen shows and movies! Also if you do make a teen section you need to add THE OFFICE and also Mr. Iglesias and Gilmore girls. I do in fact like the show Sister, Sister and Once upon a time but all of these shows and more need to be added together in one section.... the teen section!!! A lot of teens and their parents don\u2019t care about the cuss words in shows and movies so if u would add movies with light cussing my parents wouldn\u2019t really care. As long as their isn\u2019t any crazy passionate scenes or f bombs every 5 minutes, add it to the teen section!!! I\u2019m begging you I really need a teen section it would make me and many other teens love Netflix so much more. \ud83d\ude42"

Me and my family have really enjoyed watching all of the countless amounts of Movies to TV shows and the quality of them are truly fantastic. However, I would like to recommend some little changes to make someone\u2019s experience with the app even better. 1. Please add some more teens variety!!! There is really only Adults and Kids and it\u2019s hard for young teens like me for when I need a good show to watch without having it TVMA or TVY. 2. You should really consider group steaming! Some others have done this such as Disney plus but it\u2019s really helpful a specially in the pandemic where my friends can\u2019t just come over and watch a movie with me. 3. Lastly, it would be really great if you could add some more photos for the profile pictures. A lot of them are for shows that I don\u2019t even know of or are just a little weird. But other than those things, Netflix is great!"

But I am a Christian at heart, and I know that there are many different belief systems and many things that I will not agree with but I know there should be respect at the end of the day. This movie that Netflix aired on their app just made me go crazy. It was the movie about a \u201cgay\u201d Jesus and it was about a choice the \u201cgay\u201d Jesus had to make, if he wanted to be with his gay boyfriend or die on the cross for us. It bothers me because it disrespects my belief system very bad. At first it didn\u2019t bother me because there are many people who disrespect my religion so I thought, \u201chmmm, I don\u2019t agree with it but oh well Netflix is a private company.\u201d But they are making fun of my religion because I do believe God sent his only son Jesus to come to earth and die for us on the cross so he can wash away our sins. But there are many people who won\u2019t agree with me. Cool \u270c\ud83c\udffdthat\u2019s on you. But Netflix shouldn\u2019t disrespect me and many other Christians or many other believers of Jesus Christ. I unsubscribed. Bye Netflix you won\u2019t get any money from me anymore."

Even my little brother understands ( and he\u2019s a Netflix person.) !  My brother loves Sonic, for example, and I know there is the new series on Boomerang or Cartoon Network, called \u201c Sonic Boom\u201d , and that\u2019s when I realized, why isn\u2019t the new series on Netflix? Also why aren\u2019t you adding more seasons to series as well? My brother used to like Lego Ninjago and I know they have like a season 6, 7, 8 etc. , so why not put that on, for instance? And please don\u2019t take away any old shows or movies that other reviewers have talked about! I love Netflix, and others do too. So why not do what they want? Having all the episodes everyone loved!  It\u2019s a great app and all, so I suggest having it, but my suggestion should be heard!

I love the download feature which I use ever time I fly home for break. But there are some things I hope they'll consider changing. For starters let's talk about this audio description thing. I don't understand why it's the default option on my phone and there's no way to change it. I would appreciate if you added an option to change the default language setting so I'm not constantly having to switch while I'm binge watching. Secondly, the ratings system needs to return to the star system. The thumbs up and down system is to broad and I can't imagine it helps the algorithm that lists potential movies and shows I would like. If I was only lukewarm about the movie then liking it would only show more movies I wouldn't like and disliking it might hide the ones I might like. Other than that it is a really nice app that I love using",

But the reason I do not agree with the updates is that they do not include any good news, they do not make positive interface changes or optimize the app. I hope this review helps you to improve future updates of Netflix. One of the new features that I would like you to include in the Netflix interface is that you implement two 10-second buttons in order to delay and advance a series or movie since you can not currently do so, I would also like to be able to set a default playback quality either 720p, 1080p or 2160p so that when you start the title start at the quality you chose. A problem that I just noticed in a series is that House of Cards does not have the option of omitting intro and that intro is very long, the button does not appear to omit intro in any of my devices in the House of Cards series. I hope you solve it for the next update and take my words into account. Thank you",

    "review": "I strongly recommend when setting up Netflix services to do it straight through the Netflix web site  and avoid this app when subscribing, signing up any new member ship through this  Apple iTunes app. Reason being is Netflix is under strict contracts terms with Apple iTunes which limits capabilities to canceling your account, modifying payments or adjustments. Apple iTunes has full control over those specific things under contract terms. With majority of the consumers this is a very important factor. I personally had to learn the hard way. I followed the terms, canceled my subscription 24hrs before the billing date, and Apple iTunes still tried billing me another month. I received a email from Apple stating there was a billing issue. Shortly after I called Apple and clearly canceled 24 hrs before the billing date explaining the reason there is a billing issue. I was told I would have to pay for another month of service and that It wasn\u2019t 24hrs before cancellation. I hope this review will be beneficial before subscribing to a new membership using this app and strongly recommend already having a membership before attempting to down load. \nThanks",

So many more new things added to my list now.\n\nIt's still only 4 stars instead of 5, for 2 reasons:\n\n1) It's still buggy/laggy. There are times that, for no discernible reason, I try to load a show - or even just hit the \"10 seconds back\" button - and it never, ever loads. I often have to quit the app and restart it and, in extreme cases, switch off the iPad and restart it. This should be a rare-if-ever occurrence, not a fairly common one.\n\n2) I, like many other commenters, preferred the \"star\" rating system - both because of my own reactions to various films/shows, but also for the algorithm it used: I could look at how a show was rated by others, and get a pretty good idea of whether or not it would be worth my time to check out. Since moving to \"thumbs up/thumbs down\", not only do I not bother to rate any movie I don't specifically love, but I have no idea what algorithm it's using to determine whether or not I'd like it. It's usually pretty off in its estimates now anyway; I'm guessing it makes assumptions based on categories or something?\n\nOverall, the app is decent. Its algorithms are weird, and it can be hard to know what Netflix has to offer without specifically searching for it as it doctors its display to what it thinks I want to see, but the app is mostly functional.",

They ended up removing it but Germany and canada still have it. And as soon as movies come out they should be put on netflix if its not a netflix origanal. Like some movies came out 8 months ago and are just now being put on netflix. That is all i had to say but over all it is a good app.",

A year ago I was so excited to watch my little pony and for some reason their was no new season just only season 8. I looked of the date that it should come out in Netflix and said April 2019 and it was passed April 2019. I decided to look for glitch or updates and there was nothing( I\u2019m not saying this is really bad because it also happened in a other place like Disney plus). Then decided to wait for a whole and not really my little pony and my little and saw that there were clips of it in videos.

As an example total drama lost 2 of its seasons without so much as a mention they were gone and this Is not the only show this is happing too. I would list them all but that would take all day. Also stop removing shows as that really makes it hard to enjoy Netflix when are there all is trendy shows that some like. And a lot of the shows being removed and shortened some will say it is because there old but there are shows from like 1991 here and your removing 2000 shows this is a bad thing to do because soon that will be your adult audience and when they wanna watch there child hood shows they won\u2019t be there and they will stop using Netflix. In short please add back the removed seasons of some shows at least but I recommend bringing it all back and the movies too which your also removing a lot of",

There are many movies that I see in which are unavailable in my country or have been removed and only available in other countries. I think this is a problem. For example, White Chicks. I had been looking forward to rewatching White Chicks, but then I had seen it was removed. I hope that they don\u2019t remove these from our country anymore because I really enjoyed some shows that had used to be there but are not now. The second is not a big issue, but I believe it is something the people of Netflix can fix easily. Why is there only a way to move back instead of forward. It takes me a painful time to go and try to move forward a little. Instead, it just skips a minute when I only wanted to go 20 seconds ahead.

Now , I am not sure if it will stay without an english option , or maybe because the anime is a sorta new show added to Netflix ( 2018 ) and they just haven\u2019t made the english one yet, i\u2019m not sure.

If ever you can\u2019t find a show or movie to watch, you could \u201cshuffle all\u201d and it would pick something random for you to watch.

Some of the movies on Netflix are old and boring or some are for older people (adults) and some of the kid/teen shows are not very interesting, The scary movies are pretty cool its just that I wish like seriously wish IT was on Netflix, It cost money to watch it which I think is stupid, the only way to watch it for FREE is if you have a Fire Box which I don\u2019t have one, Thats why I think it should be on Netflix but lets get onto another movie, I\u2019ve been really into mean girls and I really wanna watch it, but again you need to buy it to watch it which i think is stupid because its an old movie and it should be free, but you know, cant always get ur way but it would be awesome to be on Netflix, But so far Netflix is pretty good and its easy to watch movies and I love the app a lot, im just saying- everything I said is my opinion but this is just what i wanted to say so yeah.",

I just need to separate TV shows from movies because I\u2019ll probably fall asleep in an hour or just add new things to my list.  Or have them organized by category. Sometimes I\u2019m in the mood for a mystery. Sometimes I want a comedy. Sometimes I had coffee and want to try and binge 50 episodes of a Korean drama in a weekend... sometimes I want to put my phone down and pay attention to subtitles. \nAnd maybe too much to ask, but the majority of my ratings are 3 stars because they\u2019re \u201cmeh\u201d. Neither thumbs up or thumbs down. Is there like a sideways thumb rating...?

They have taken away American Dad, The Cleveland Show, and Bob\u2019s Burgers, And now they are starting to take away Family Guy. I have watched everyone of those shows at least 23x each. ( Yes I have a problem ) and now that just took them away. They also took away my childhood shows too, like 6Teen, Invader Zim, And Crowder.. I understand that you need to make some space for new stuff.. but you could still make space and leave stuff on there, you should just clean out all the shows that are Netflix Originals that got canceled. Or clean out the stuff that no one watches. But hey, I still love using Netflix, I\u2019ll never stop using it, it\u2019s just a small issue that I have.",

But I pay for the service and since Netflix had once had the good sense to let us personalize our content page (even though it wasn\u2019t perfect), they should still offer that choice.\n\nAlso, most of the new movies are Netflix films and the rest are generally old movies or something I haven\u2019t heard of.\n\nOther than that, there is a lot of good content on Netflix and the price (even though it\u2019s no longer $7.99) is still inexpensive; however, due to everything I stated above, am finding it harder and harder to justify keeping it because I\u2019m running out of content I find interesting or something I want to watch or suitable for my kid.",

I loved 13 reasons why, stranger things and okja, to name a few. What I don\u2019t like is the x-rated stuff on there that they call UR or NR and the limited parental controls. Not everything that\u2019s unrated is of a sexually explicit nature but some of it is. So if I want to protect my teenagers from watching porn on Netflix, I can\u2019t because if I am okay with certain unrated documentaries, I can\u2019t set any guidelines for that. I actually can\u2019t set guidelines between R-rated and rated-MA, it\u2019s like an All or nothing type of parental control system. I would like to be able to select up to an R rating and block MA and most unrated shows but I can\u2019t. I would also like the option to remove certain shows/movies from my account to make sure my kids don\u2019t watch them. It\u2019s hard enough these days to protect your kids, but this parental control system in Netflix doesn\u2019t help at all. I just might have to cancel :(",

I have already watched the entire series and am dying to see the movies again. I know you can\u2019t have every movie up at once, but please put Hotel Transylvania up again. Mavis is my favorite character, so I\u2019m trying to get her full backstory, and for that I need the other movies. (Also I want to watch them again for fun.) So please, but them up again. Thank you in advance!",

I think that you should do do a preteens section that can provide cartoons but also more coming of age movies and tv shows so that they can find stuff that doesn\u2019t bore them. This would be wonderful if you could do. The preteen that lives in my house thinks that Netflix is a great platform but finds that the kids section is boring her with cartoons and movies and tv shows that she simply doesn\u2019t watch. If this happens in the future please know that they are preteens and they need shows and movies that are appropriate to them.

I recommend Netflix because it's really good, and there's no way you've seen EVERY movie or show on Netflix, so theres a lot to watch. The best part about Netflix is that there are no commercials, and you can watch what you want offline. People who like to binge watch, or watch moives and stuff like that, will certainly love Netflix. Some downfalls of this app are, paying for Netflix monthly, the selection of movies/shows depends on where you live, and it takes a while for a new season/episode to come out.

I like to watch Netflix on car trips and when I have no service so I download my movies or shows but sometimes there is the one episode on a show that you really like to watch and then you can\u2019t download it anymore so you cant watch it without service witch I think defeats the whole purpose of being able to download it.

I understand, unlike others, deals are made and content comes and goes.\n\nWhat I have a problem with is interfaces that don't allow users control of settings that allow them to use the service as it suits their needs. Netflix has a history of trying to force feed content by using Auto functions to keep users on it's platform for as long as possible. Users have fought this over the years forcing rollbacks of these intrusions on their privacy. \n\nAfter the last consumer vs. Netflix battle over Autoplaying trailers, having to give users the option to turn it off, Netflix lost no time in instituting another Autoplay play feature that was even more horrendous than the last. Now one can not select a show or movie without Netflix auto-starting it on certain streaming devices like Firestick.\n\nAs someone who is handicapped this obnoxious feature forces me in many instances to have to stop or click back or restart where I want to begin. It also leaves the menu hovering over it as it begins playing which is just in poor taste. Sometimes I would even like to play a trailer but this is now a hassle.\n\nThe point is not that this feature exists, it is that we again do not have the option to opt out. I urge those of you who also find this offensive to let your feelings be known. Users have fought these battles before and won and since Netflix is not the only kid on the block anymore, they should listen."

In contrast, Netflix via Roku works like a charm.\n\nThe app removes notifications if you back out of that screen!  Which means that if you inadvertently tap or try to delete a single one, you've lost any list of shows Netflix claims you like.  Ah!  Turns out that going back to notifications makes them show up again \u2014why they vanished, however, is a mystery.\n\nThe tabs in the tab bar on the left side are too small, so it's too easy to hit the wrong choice.\n\n\u2014-> Worst of all, though, with the iPad app is that there seems to be no way of rearranging the shows in one's Watch List!\n\nThat needs fixing.  A drag-and-drop editing function would be the cat's meow!  On the web, it *seems* to have that ability, but it doesn't work!  Come on, developers, this is so basic, fix it!\n\nBy the way, Netflix's moving to thumbs up or thumbs down instead of a 5-star rating system is a MAJOR STEP BACKWARDS \n\nWhat was needed was to change the adjectives.  Several years back they offered a million dollar prize to improve their algorithm \u2014 which, curiously, was NEVER awarded!  Up-down is too simplistic and lacks the refinement needed to fine tune tastes and preferences."

Oh and another show I\u2019m suggesting that be added on Netflix is all of the seasons of Big Time Rush. If you could do that, I would REALLY appreciate it. I appreciate you guys adding more movies to the To All The Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before Collection and I LOVE the movies! Another thing I would have to complain about though Is the fact that you guys took F\u2022R\u2022I\u2022E\u2022N\u2022D\u2022S off of Netflix. I was BEYOND disappointed when this happened because being new to the show I hadn\u2019t finished all of the seasons of the show, I thought that Netflix would\u2019ve brought It back by now, but unfortunately they still haven\u2019t.

Let me explain. If I watch like the first episode of a certain show and I decide I don\u2019t want to watch it, I can\u2019t take it out of my continue watching list. Then, I would have to skip through every episode until the credits come on and the buttons come up saying watch next episode. Sometimes even that doesn\u2019t work. I have three shows on my continue watching list that I don\u2019t want to watch but can\u2019t get it off of the list. It would be very nice if there was a button like the add to list button but it removes the show or movie from the continue watching list. I just thought I might bring this up because this annoys me."

I love how you can download movies or shows for on the go and it\u2019s easy to find the type of genre you want to find in a show or movie. Although Netflix is very good, the process of adding and taking off movies/shows is something that really irritates me and many other people I know. I would like to enjoy many of the movies that were once on Netflix but they have been taken off. The only other way to see these beloved shows/ movies are to buy or rent them which is costly. I\u2019m hoping that the people of Netflix can see this and maybe add back some of the old movies that were once on Netflix like Titanic and many other great films. Thank you and I\u2019m begging to please add back some of the old movies like starstruck, and many other childhood movies plus Titanic. Thanks."

I\u2019ve just kinda stopped using Netflix because there aren\u2019t enough animes on it. There are SOME, but most of them aren't very good. I mean there are a FEW good ones on here (Attack on Titan, Sword Art Online, Violet Evergarden, ect.) But there aren\u2019t very many good ones. I would love to see better ones. Also with the profile changes, I would LOVE IT if you could attach a password to your profile to change it, because my brother is always changing mine to dumb stuff. He always makes my name stupid, random, or just changes it all together. It annoys me a lot. Could you please add this? And maybe more anime profile pictures. If you could do any of these things, I would be very grateful, and I might even use Netflix more often."

    "review": "Would have given this app a 4 out of 5 stars  review but it didn\u2019t seem quite genuine since that\u2019s not a thing you can do on the app itself. Why did star reviews go away? Who possibly thought that was a good idea? Was this just done to acquiesce to millenials\u2019 short attention spans and lack of critical thinking skills? So much content on Netflix is deserving of 4 stars because it\u2019s well imagined and executed but not exceptional. Or myriad other reasons. Some content should earn 2 stars because maybe it\u2019s derivative or hampered by poor production values and while it doesn\u2019t deserve a good rating it merits saying that it wasn\u2019t awful. Or myriad other reasons. Some content you don\u2019t regret having watched but it was definitely a waste of time. There\u2019s the application for a 3 star review. Getting the most accurate feedback possible on your bank of great content would serve you best, regardless of what the data from whatever tests and studies led to this abomination of a decision said. Please keep creating and licensing great stuff and please bring back star reviews."

I\u2019m still not sure of whether it\u2019s true or not (like if it was there to begin with). I know I could always switch my vpn to Germany or India but that would only allow me to watch anime on my phone and in Japanese,I know that\u2019s not bad but I prefer English.

Sure, I can set things up to force a password but the preview picture and or quick clip of the movie are just as bad as watching it! If the purpose of parental control is to remove those things from an impressionable mind then showing a preview of it is not exactly a good thing. Surely it can\u2019t be that hard to set a control where if a program is rated r or m that they just remove it from view. Please consider this netflix..."

Netflix is great, but it has resentful taken a lot of the shows off that kids and teens love. Even if you take them off, Netflix is really bad at updating shows. The new seasons come out on Netflix a year after they were released and it takes forever for new shows and movies to appear.

So whenever you watch a show you have to wait for like a year for the next season or more episodes to come. Which I absolutely think you guys should speed things up a bit more! For example Riverdale. Riverdale only has one season out on Netflix but on like C & W there\u2019s season 2 and I bet even the other seasons which just isn\u2019t fair.\n\n2. Netflix has shows and movies. Some good some bad. But mostly bad other than good it\u2019s really hard to find a good movie or show. There isn\u2019t even Cinderella or the classic Disney movies. Which you guys should add in all the classics. \n\n3. Stop taking out movies! All the movies you guys take out are good movies. All the bad movies stay on Netflix. This movie.. a great movie called The Boy In The Striped Pajamas. Which was the most sad movie I have ever watched. The most heart warming and heart breaking. It\u2019s probably my favorite true story that ended up in a movie and it\u2019s just not fair it got taken off of Netflix like the other good movies. It should come to an end. Lots of people have different movie opinions and I understand you guys are trying to put good movies in and bad out. But you all are doing the oppisite.\n\nThose are just my errors.

My family had 8 people which is a lot and we all need our OWN Netflix profile but the limit is five which makes me sad.

They have a pretty good catalog with movies for almost all. For tweens I would say not enough superheroe cartoons. These cartoons consist of Teen Titans(Go) or Young Justice( a show that has been recently pulled out from the catalog). Also I wish somehow instead waiting a year for the season to come we could wait six months. My parents wish that there was two more things, privacy and rating. My guardians would like some privacy because they don\u2019t want me to snoop on what they are watching. The rating system is ok. But I think they should go back to the five stars rating process. If it is not available on mobile devices. Then at least on the television.\nI hope Netflix could but my dreams in reality. \nLove\nNetflix lover",

I tried to get on this morning and instead of it loading my profile, it just brought up a black screen with loading dots. I tried to restart my phone and then deleted the app, thinking I could just log back in when I downloaded the app again. I was surprisingly wrong. I went back into the app, and put in my account information to be surprised with an error saying I had put in the wrong information. To my dismay I redid the information, being meticulous about it as I typed it, and it STILL did not work. I have 5 episodes of Riverdale left. 5! I went to the website, and as a final check to make sure I wasn\u2019t going crazy, I tried to log in, and it worked! I went back to the app, bud sadly it didn\u2019t work. I called support, and whereas the guy was nice, since I\u2019m not the owner of the account and my mom is, he could not do much. I would love to finish Riverdale before Sunday, so this issue needs to be addressed right now!",

I\u2019ve even tried updating Netflix a few times but that seemed to do nothing.I never got to finish my series and to this day I haven\u2019t been able to get it back on my Account.

I hate when I am watching a show and then all the sudden out of nowhere audio goes out and all I can see is their lips moving and I have no clue what they\u2019re saying because I can\u2019t hear anything. This works my nerves and I\u2019m sure I am not the only person to complain about this. It doesn\u2019t matter what show I\u2019m watching or how many TVs are running Netflix or devices are running Netflix at the same time the audio will go out. Even if I go back and rewind the show the audio is still out on those parts. I\u2019m wondering what can Netflix do to fix this? \nYou would think with as much money as Netflix makes and the shows they produce that we would not have this problem with the audio.

    "review": "I enjoy Netflix as anyone does. My only pet peeve is, whenever I download the videos stored on my i0S, it is only accessible when your profile is actively set/used. The saved video won\u2019t play if your profile is not enabled. Sometimes the app forces me to re-select the profile after not using the app. Whenever and wherever I\u2019m in without any wifi/internet access, I couldn\u2019t select my profile thus my saved videos will not be playable because the profile is not enabled. This alone defeats the point of having saved videos to be playable when you are without internet access. Netflix should consider enabling profile without being dependent to internet. They can set the profile to check the server once the internet access is valid before the profile kicks one out with rationale. Not the other way around.",

I rarely find old movies. Some movies I think you should add is, Dirty Dancing, The Outsiders, Karate Kid, and that\u2019s just to name a few. I also think Netflix should add other sections like for teens or for the elderly because like mine and many parents, they won\u2019t let there kids have adult account because they have some shows/ movies that are rated R but if you make a section for teens, all the teens won\u2019t have to watch kiddy cartoons, they could watch pg-13. I think you should make a section for the elderly and put old movies that you can\u2019t find anywhere.\n \n(Thank you Netflix for reading this, this is just a recommendation because I think you will get a lot more people \ud83d\ude0a )\nLove- C",

This slows down the UI and is constantly trying to play a preview.  If I want to see/hear a preview I will select it.  \n\nThe updated show rating system is horrible.  Previously you had a five star rating system and now they \"improved\" that to thumb-up/thumb-down only rating which offers us no way to rate a show at all.  Many of the programs I watch on Netflix just don't deserve either a thumb-up or down rather something in the middle but we have lost all of the flexibility when rating programs. This is very frustrating to me because very few programs I watch can be described to others or to the recommendation algorithm Netflix uses to determine what shows to recommend to me when I look for future programming.\n\nThese are just two examples of changes they have made that have made the service less desirable to use.\n\nI have contacted them about these and many of the other changes they have made to the UI with no results.  Over the last few years far more of the changes they have made using the service worse instead of better.  I've found myself using Netflix less and less and one of the competing services more and more.  If they continue on this path much longer I plan to cancel my subscription.",

Sometimes I\u2019ll be scrolling on Netflix and see an interesting show/movie that I think looks good but I don\u2019t want to watch at that very second. Instead of forgetting about the show because I didn\u2019t start watching it as soon as I saw it, I wish I could just add it to a list to watch it later. So that way, as soon as I open Netflix it\u2019s right there, reminding me how interesting it looks.",

Not to mention that the most recent updates have kind of sent Netflix down the gutter. I really enjoyed being able to see a rating for each selection out of five stars, and I also enjoy being able to input my own rating rather than just a thumbs up or thumbs down. Another setback, on mobile devices when selecting a movie or show to watch, you are not met with a description but rather tags for what the movie has to offer, such as \u201cvampire\u201d or \u201cgirl power\u201d. For me, that isn\u2019t enough to decide whether I want to watch something or not. Netflix, I implore and beg of you, please bring back the star ratings and the selection descriptions.

Here are some of its app\u2019s obnoxious \u201cfeatures\u201d.\n\n(1) When you open the app, you are greeted with an advertisement\u2014for some show / movie that you never wanted to watch\u2014that covers literally 90% of your screen.  They refuse even to show you the entire icon of any other show that might be on your list; that row of icons is pushed so far down to the bottom that their bottom half is pushed off the screen.\n\n(2) The app plays a preview\u2014with *sound*\u2014of any show or movie that is highlighted.  That means that if you want silence, you should quit the app, rather than just stay where you are.\n\n(3) The app does not care what you were just watching the last time you used it.  Ot does not put that show or movie front and center, where you can continue watching with one tap.  Instead, you have to hunt for it.\n\n(4) The app doesn\u2019t even order its categories (rows) in the same way from one use to the next.  Again, this forces you to hunt through its rows to find the show you were literally just watching.\n\n(5) Netflix refuses to let Apple TV\u2019s TV app access its data.  To watch a Netflix show, you are forced to use the Netflix app, with its problems 1-4 listed above.\n\nNetflix: if you wanted to get users to like your app, you\u2019ve failed.

The fact that you made an episode about khaled aldossary without including facts is disgusting! He was a chemical engineering student and he ordered chemicals for educational purposes and the company that sells these chemicals for students filed a report against him because they felt \"suspicious\" because he is saudi/muslim even though they sell to other students. But later it was proven that the chemicals cannot be used for making weapons/ bombs of any sort but it was too late because he was already sentenced for life in prison! And for what?! For nothing?! As a company you shouldn't be biased!! I understand that Netflix is mostly run by white males but that doesn't mean that you can\u2019t be more educated about other cultures and less racist.\n\nNetflix has proven that it\u2019s a racist company.

They don\u2019t really have anything that are actually relatable for teens. I also think you should add a lot of more throwbacks and teen movies that aren\u2019t rated-R. A lot of the movies are either kids movies or movies that parents would watch when your kids go to sleep. There are teen movies that are rated PG-13, but they mostly have adult humor and those are movies that aren\u2019t really that great. Also, I love the original series on Netflix, but all the teens are played by people that are in their mid-20s or about to be thirty. This is just a suggestion, but can you please make the teens on TV shows actually played by teens? And can you also make \u201cDrama\u201d by Raina Telgimier a teen movie? That\u2019s all I have.

Don\u2019t bother getting attached.\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of the majority of Netflix shows that I\u2019ve seen (most are poorly made and acted and how did they manage to ruin Arrested Development?), and the few that are good are always canceled after a few seasons no matter how popular they are, and so you are rarely able to go on a binge session with any of their shows. And now they are not holding onto any of the shows that so many of us enjoy, I guess so they can spend their money making 500 new garbage shows instead of one good one? \n\nthe app itself is so frustrating because even if you do find something you want to watch while you\u2019re traveling and think, \u201chey!

I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll see this but I hope that maybe somehow you could pick it up and help them renew the show so they can get a season 2. It had 14 million viewers on globoplay for their first season, which is pretty awesome, and I know that if it becomes a Netflix original it can be even bigger.

May I consider more  horrors,Thrillers and more of that category instead of the same dusty movies since 2 years. I\u2019m sure many people would prefer Friday and the continued series after that and so on. May I suggest my personal favorites.... Madea Movies! You have none what so ever. How can you increase your prices but give your customers a limited selection. You can do better! You only pretend to care about what your customers want but really all you care about it the money because Netflix is becoming sorry. I\u2019m only giving it 5 stars so this review can be seen",

    "review": "Netflix seriously needs to improve their subtitles on the app.  As an avid anime fan, I greatly appreciate the addition of the shows that have been added in recent years.  However, watching these in the subbed versions as many in the community prefer, is near impossible with the shoddy subtitle quality.  The text often is thin, usually either white or yellow and has no background or outlining whatsoever.  This leads to confusing scenes where you have white text on a white background and it is quite literally impossible to read.  Some shows have had a black background behind the text, which is fine and allows readability, but I cannot understand why there is not a continuity in the quality of subtitles.\nThis is the biggest complaint I have ever had of the service, as nothing else has bothered me to the point of literally being unable to watch a show or film of interest.",

When i\u2019m watching Anime i\u2019ve come to notice Netflix only ever only has one or two seasons completely leaving out the rest of the Anime series. It\u2019s problematic and unfair because we then wonder what\u2019s happening next and we\u2019re left with gran anticipation. I suggested you bring other Anime shows as well such as my hero acedamia so on so forth. Plus add the rest of the Anime series for the other animations such as attack on the titans, black butler, Haikyu. I feel like it would add more variety to the app itself and lure other people who love to watch anime as well. Not only that but you\u2019re leaving good shows unfinished which is quit triggering.

I notice there was only kids and adult stuff, can you make It fair for the teens and add teen related shows on there. Plus somebody from tiktok had shows and movies they get to watch while others are stuck with the same shows. That\u2019s not fair at all cause of how we get tired of all these shows and movies and she herself has Teen Titans, and other shows and movies we won\u2019t be able to see. And can you please  bring back the movies like Coco and all other deleted movies, one time I saw it on my home page back in 2019, now it\u2019s gone without a trace, so please bring it back, it would be an honor.\nFrom, your Netflix fan\nA\u2019zyani Greene.",

I get on there most times to find the movie I want to watch not there. I realize Netflix is not going to have everything, but I feel like it should have the popular movies that are trending even if they are older. It makes people not have to pay for movies if they just search up the movie on Netflix, and most times it comes up cause it\u2019s trending. Sometimes I find shows/movies that not many people really watch, so there for it\u2019s not trending. All I\u2019m saying is could there possibly be more trending shows that Netflix can get, so we don\u2019t have to pay for a single movie.",

It\u2019s absolutely awesome, but there is a big problem in the app and that problem is that they take certain tv shows and movies off the website. It really irritates me because I could be in the middle of a season in a show and they would just take it away. For example, Jessie was one of my favourite Disney shows. I was in the middle of a marathon and boom. They took it off the app. I was very upset and I still am very very upset. If there was one show they could bring back I would want it would be Jessie. I hope they do bring  Jessie back (please please please bring it back). This is why I give this app four stars instead of five.",

And lastly, I would like something for actually rating it, because I feel that all the movies either have four or five star ratings, and it\u2019s really hard to decide when all of them have the same ratings. The user ratings let us know what other users thought and it lets us better remember how we ourselves thought the movie was. Other than that, it\u2019s a great app. Thanks!",

TAKE OFF GOOSEBUMPS AND PUT THE HAUNTING HOUR BACK on WITH the 2 seasons you NEVER put on. \n    Yes. Netflix took off my most favorite show, The Haunting Hour by RL Stine. It ticked me off so bad I felt like I had to leave this review. It would\u2019ve been different if they still played it on The Haunted Hub (Family Channel), BUT THEY DON\u2019T I was also super ticked whenever I realized that, UH OH, there were 4 seasons but were only 2 on the one in netflix! This made me so flipping mad (I found out after Netflix deleted it) and then they DELETED it?!?! Me and my friends live in Mississippi and that is like our favorite show. We watch when we sleepover, at parties, and whenever we\u2019re in the car. It made me look forward to Netflix everyday. AND YES it made me scared, but it also gave me memories. That show was the best. I really miss it. Me and my friends have so many memories from watching that and jumping and covering our faces.\n\n     And then you took it off.\n Then I sent this narrowing review about how flipped I am at Netflix. THERE BETTER be a developer response or I am going to be SOOOOO FREAKING MAD. And if you do put it back (which I doubt \ud83d\ude21) please add the new seasons.\n      I\u2019m also sorry about sending this review. The point is just PLEASE put that show back on!\n Thank you!",

I'm a tween and I've been watching Netflix for at least 2 years. Almost 3 years, and I've seen movies that have cussing in them, yet it's the kids section. Like for example, the movie Fireworks has the A word in it. Now another topic is the removals. Movies like Lilo and Stitch, The Nutcracker and more have been removed  and I end up having to ask my dad to pay for a movie because it isn't on Netflix anymore. One more thing is that there are shows on Netflix that I love but don't have the whole series. Like in Henry Danger, it stops at season 3 when there are more than 3 seasons. This is all I have to say. Thanks for reading this. Have a nice day (and consider this)!",

(I liked it more when Netflix had Nick jr options. Then a few years ago they switched to the corporate demon-Disney instead, and not in addition to. I don\u2019t allow my child to watch most of Disney channel, but was allowed to watch anything on Nick Jr. They actually care about your child\u2019s development. Disney only about holding he kids attention.)\n\nI like that I can rate tittles, I miss when I could comment....probably got out of hand though lol\n\nI commend Netflix, they do not seem to have payed reviews like Prime does. This is a superior service but has a lesser rating than Prime, who obviously has fluffed their reviews",

This started happening last week (beginning of Feb 2020). Also, dates for episodes are out of synch between Netflix device apps (see dates available for tv show Find Yourself between iPhone app and Roku tv app). Specific shows impacted so far that I watch: Find Yourself, Itaewon Class, Crash Landing on You. For example, right now it is Feb 9th, 2020 and the next episode for Crash Landing states it will be available to view on Feb 9th! They used to be available first thing at midnight, now I\u2019ll be checking all day to no avail. Please make them available consistently at midnight or state what time they\u2019ll be available!\n\n2nd issue: since updating my iPhone app a few days ago, Netflix is very laggy and each time I launch the app, it takes a while to load and each time it asks to pick which user profile to load.  I\u2019ve only used  one profile on this app, WHY does it keep asking all of a sudden? Make it stop asking when nothing has changed!

If you\u2019re going to have your kids watch Netflix, change their account to the Kids mode. This mode blocks all the TV-MA/R and PG-13 shows and movies. And if you don\u2019t want your kid watching even the PG movies and shows, you can set their accounts to little kids which blocks all but G content. I don\u2019t know if you can change it to little kids mode on devices, but I am able to do this on my TV when setting up their account. You can also change it so only TV-MA/R content is blocked if you have an older kid. \n\n2. There really needs to be a better system to warn viewers when a show is going to be taken off. Maybe a notification or every 3 months they list the shows that\u2019ll be gone and the ones that\u2019ll be coming?\n\n3. The My List does need to be easily organized somehow. Sometimes I want to watch a show that I\u2019ve already seen but have to search it because it takes forever to find it. Maybe a simple filing system or even alphabetical?\n\n4. Maybe a notification only when shows you are watching get another season? It\u2019s sometimes annoying when I get notifications for shows I don\u2019t even know about. That\u2019s it.",

The 100 is a sci-fi show where they\u2019re was a nuclear war and everyone has been living in space for 100 years, but they are running out of oxygen, so they send 100 prisoners back down to earth where the teens have to find out how to live on the ground, and they\u2019re not alone. The show gets better every season, but this show is very violent. The story is very intriguing and warning, you might get addicted to watching the show to find out what happens next, and every season they\u2019re presented with a new threat.",

I did my research and apparently this has happened to many others. Apparently only devices that support HDCP would work and you guys aren\u2019t planning to change that. Through more research I figured out other companies do this with their screen mirroring, too. I do not see why you guys will not change this.

However, Sword Art Online is actually rated TV-14 but on Netflix it rated it its self (TV-MA). It bugs me, why does the age rating change so much? Blue Exorcist had hardly any thing that\u2019s to reveling, but it changes from TV-14 to TV-MA. Also, the thing that I find annoying is just that they don\u2019t have a that much anime, I\u2019m saying for the kid section. It has some bad I\u2019m not joking BAD anime. I\u2019m 12 and this is bad! Like the bad stuff. Fireworks, loved it, good for anime starters but... this is how I transition to a custom profile. I think you should add it so the owner who pays it should be able to add things to their child\u2019s profile, add things they like, remove things they don\u2019t like. \n\nThank you for reading this GREAT, OUTSTANDING,PLUCKY ( Yes, I know what it means and I understand I\u2019m using it incorrectly but I\u2019m not in ELA am I?) paragraph :D"

There are a lot of improvements with the app itself but I think for offline mode, it would be best if there is a pause button on the downloads as, as at times, you have to go out without finishing the download and it would be smart if there was a pause button than to let the app try downloading the episode. Also, if you accidentally close the app from the background, and open it again, it says failed download. So I really think there should be a pause button. Lastly, more Asian dramas please!

It has allowed me to watch all of my favorite Marvel movies like Infinity War, Thor Ragnarock and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 as many times as I want! In addition, every 2 years I get to watch more of my favorite show (Stranger Things). I love the Netflix originals like Trollhunters. I loved the Series of Unfortunate Events books and I was excited when they made a show out of them. It was incredibly similar to the book and they did a great job. Netflix is by far the best app on iPhone. It\u2019s not too laggy, it\u2019s easy to navigate, new shows come in a lot and the Netflix originals are amazing!",

However, I truly find it odd that when a movie is introduced on their platform that promotes natural beauty of African American hair, it\u2019s not on the main screen of the app when you first open it (even though the movie just released today) There was barely promotion on the Netflix instagram, and it wasn\u2019t even on the what\u2019s new or what\u2019s trending section of the site. I Literally had to search for it. Maybe I don\u2019t know how this is supposed to work? But overall, please try to do better with pushing content like this !

However a recent update to the app makes it so that the lineup of shows that I\u2019m watching is in a drop down menus style, this makes it so much more difficult to get to the show that I want to continue watching, also if I want to watch a specific episode of said show I have to go and actually search for the show in order to be given more information and the option of picking another episode. It\u2019s honestly ridiculous and time consuming and just tedious. I watch Netflix to relax after having a long day and this is frankly just annoying. I would be very happy if the app is switched back to its original format. Otherwise I\u2019m afraid this would make me cancel my subscription.

Recently things have changed and Netflix has decided to add explicit adult content to their streaming service. In fact, a large portion of the new Netflix originals are explicitly sexual or gory. They also have graphic, hardcore porn mingled in with the indie flicks. The parental controls are null and void when anyone can easily switch profiles to access the main adult profile without a password (Duh?). You have no way to filter or delete the graphic content that you are subjected to viewing on your suggestions lists, it's there all the time whether you care to see it or not. Enough is enough! We were loyal Netflix viewers for so many years due to their family friendly content, well I guess that's over with, Netflix seems to be all about earning itself a sleazier nickname.

Especially when on some streaming devices, the movie previews start automatically. What if my kids had been with me? I immediately deleted the app. This is just ridiculous.",

I don\u2019t need to be TOLD what to watch, do, buy, eat, etc., I can make up my mind on my own.\n\nHowever, the testing of adding trailers or commercials is additionally insulting when you take out the basic synopsis for shows and movies. I like the addition of \u201ctags\u201d, but not at the loss of an actual description of the movie. If I don\u2019t know enough about a show from a description, I like the OPTIONAL trailers that are provided to watch on my own time.

But in order to do that now I have to use the little time bar to rewind. The little time bar doesn\u2019t go as little as ten seconds back. It goes like a minute back.

Netflix even said themselves and issued a \u201ctrigger warning\u201d about sex and nudity of the 11 year olds. This movie is so wrong in so many ways and promotes child pornography. Reading the description of this movie and seeing part of the trailer is in so many ways wrong and disturbing. This movie needs to be removed right away from Netflix and nothing ever like it should be produced. I am extremely disappointed in Netflix because they not only one support child pornography, but they also do not see how this is wrong. This is supposed to be an app safe for children to use, this movie shows the opposite. The girls in this movie are only kids so they do not understand how this is wrong. This movie makes me sick.",

What started out as a good fun family friendly show for the first two seasons suddenly got loaded with cursing and sexual jokes in season 3. We turned it off mid way through the first episode.\n\nSecond, it was becoming increasingly difficult to find any good movies that we even cared to watch. We would sometimes spend up to an hour or more just browsing through trying to find anything interesting.\n\nThird, and this was the final deal breaker for us, was when they started releasing movies that directly attacked our Christian faith in how they portrayed Jesus.\n\nWe decided to return to Netflix just briefly for the holidays to enjoy a few of the Christmas movies and just in this short time, they have already removed one of the movies that made us want to reactivate our account and I have also been disgusted to see the amount of outright pornographic movies they have added. I actually look forward to deleting our account again at the end of the month.\n\nIf I were to say something positive though, the movie Klaus is really good!

When I asked questions about why I had this problem and how to fix it she said there were just glitches sometimes. As I asked another question she said she had no control over what Netflix did. I then asked if she want Netflix? Who did I just call? Yes, this was Netflix the company but she had no control. I asked if she couldn\u2019t submit feedback and she said all calls were recorded. Oh, and best of all when I asked about fixing my problem she said she could CANCEL MY ACCOUNT! Clearly they are making too much money and DON\u2019T CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMERS! They should just put up a recording that says our customers service reps are just here to collect a paycheck, not to help you!",

I would really appreciate it if maybe we could bring back some of the old shows and movies. \n\nI grew up watching a LOT of the old Justice League shows and Batman stuff, and it'd be nice if my siblings could do the same as well. The only problem, is there's literally nothing cartoonish concerning Batman and Justice League and all that good stuff on Netflix. \n\nSo please, bring that back, the Justice League shows and Batman cartoon movies. That would definitely make me give you a five star rating. Nonetheless, the system is great, and I recommend it to anyone reading this!! Thank you very much, and God bless!",

And if you are going to post the seasons separately then do it closer together don\u2019t wait more then a year to post the other season.

In Matthew 14:33 after Jesus walks on water, the disciples tell Jesus: \"You really are the Son of God!\" In response to the question by Jesus, \"But who do you say that I am?\", Peter replied: \"You are Christ, the Son of the living God\".

That\u2019s nice, but guess what happens if you double-tap near the middle of the screen, where the play/pause control is?  Not play/pause, because that would make too much sense.  No, it rewinds or fast-forwards, depending on precisely which half of the screen the double-tap lands.\n\nIf I pause in the middle of a video and switch to another app, when I come back, instead of returning to the video I was watching, I get kicked out to the main screen.  I guess Netflix wants to promote whatever they promote on the main screen more than they want me to watch the show I\u2019m watching.\n\nAll in all, annoyances all around, and they add up to such a poor experience that I\u2019m not going to continue my subscription when my free trial expires.  Netflix had a strong brand, what a disappointment!",

    "review": "Great app. Good price. Easy to use and the download for offline is a great feature to have even if its not for every show or movie. App works well except for three issues. \n\n#1 is that the Continue Watching category doesn\u2019t always show up even if i close the app multiple times. So i have to search the movie or show i was watching to track it down which is really annoying. \n\n#2 is that the ratings have gone from a 5-star system to a thumbs up or down system. A minor issue but i find it much better to be able to rate something on a scale of 1-5 instead of 1-2. \n\n#3 is that there used to be an alert when selecting a show or movie that said it would soon be taken off of Netflix. Another somewhat minor issue but really great to have. I haven\u2019t seen one in months and when a show or movie gets taken off while im halfway in or so it can be really disappointing. Maybe add a category of shows that will soon be taken off so we can enjoy them before they silently take off. Another great addition would be to also add a list of shows coming soon to Netflix so that we know if something shows up that will really interest us.",

If I\u2019m lucky, at a minimum five times. I thought it was the headphones so I took those out. The problem persists. Thought it was bad connection. Nope. Tried LTE, WiFi in three different places on different occasions, even a friend\u2019s data hotspot. Problem still persists. \n\nThe app\u2019s gone down south lately.

I was in the middle of watching all of those, then you just go and delete them? The heck, other than deleting shows, the quality of Netflix is pretty good. If you keep deleting shows, then I'll just not pay anymore, or use it. Losing clients=Less money. :) Edit: Is it possible to request shows to be added on? If so, I would recommend Naruto Shippuden, in general Naruto is popular on Netflix. I'm sure other people would enjoy watching the rest of Naruto, yes they are many other apps to watch on, but we already paid for this. Maybe you could add Naruto Shippuden? Just a small suggestion!",

It seems rather flippant of Netflix to say creating a child\u2019s profile and then letting the parents make sure they use the right one is any kind of effective control.  Parents can not and should not have to watch over their kids shoulder to make sure they are using the correct profile.  Come on NETFLIX, get a grip and let us put pins on profiles.  The other option you suggest, putting a pin on maturity level across all profiles is needlessly cumbersome and inconvenient.  For as much as you charge for you decreasing level of offerings I don\u2019t know why this should be a problem for you.",

Bring back the layout I describe for watching on phones back immediately if you want people to continue with this streaming service.

As they have no way of gauging your level of interest in a particular type of movie, they only know you hated it or didn\u2019t. \n\nMaybe that was their intent behind this Luddite move.

I don\u2019t know how that should make me feel because lately there hasn\u2019t been any interesting movies at Netflix and I been waiting for almost 2 years for netflix to air the 8th season of TVD but I thought maybe I had to wait a little longer but when I was with my relatives they had the season 8 and some other movies I been wanting to watch. The movies that I have on Netflix when I\u2019m hometown really are wack and bizarre.\nAnother reason why I rate one star will be because we can\u2019t rate movies anymore or watch how many stars a movie has. That was a really helpful feature but now with the percent and the thumbs up and down makes me want to not have Netflix anymore.",

This disgusts me. Even if Jesus had a girlfriend in this movie, it would still be extremely disrespectful, because the makers of these movies are sexualizing Christ.

I\u2019m not wasting any more money on a dying service that can\u2019t even handle such a simple operation as downloading",

I\u2019ll close out the program and try again but no go. The only thing that works is shutting down and restarting my iPad. This also happens if I\u2019m watching a movie and I happen to stop to open up a browser to maybe check the weather or something.

However, ever since Netflix Originals have been coming out, their updates have taken away some fantastic shows (like The X-Files, Malcolm in the Middle, and other fantastic classics). Their updates have taken away the star ratings and added percentage match which is no help in trying to find a new, good show; for it doesn\u2019t rate quality, just commonality. My main concern is being halfway through completing a series and Netflix takes away the series with the update. Also, it could have a more extensive 4K category. A lot of the shows in 4K are in the drama category. Great app, don\u2019t recommend as your only source of tv though.",

But I don\u2019t always have internet access when I\u2019m staying and because of this reason I download most of the episodes to watch it later. The problem is that I later found out that I can\u2019t watch the downloaded episodes with my unofficial lighting to HDMI cable that is working fine with other apps. I didn\u2019t try the streaming but even if it woks with streaming I will still have the internet access problem. I will now have to take my laptop with me to an internet accessible place to download so I can be able to later plug my laptop to the TV and watch. Please fix this. Thank you.",

Also, the past month, it defaults to the setting of \u201cnarrative\u201d so I then have to pause the movie and click on the setting so that it takes it off. No idea why it suddenly defaults to that and no clue how to change the default to just playing the movie without it narrating it.

    "review": "Netflix is an amazing app. They have great shows to watch and I really enjoy the app. I have a few suggestions for the app though. \n\nFirst, we should have more sections. The kids section has a bunch of shows, but a lot of them are more aimed towards 3-8 year olds instead of all ages. There should be more sections like the toddler section for 1-6 year olds, a kids section for 7-10 year olds, a preteen section for 11-14 year olds, teen section for 15-17 year olds, and the adult section for everyone 18+. I feel like it would just be way more organized that way. The teen section should have a few cuss words as long as it isn\u2019t excessive. \n\nTwo, please make a setting where you can turn off the \u201cAre you still watching\u201d prompt. It honestly gets so annoying when I\u2019m watching a show that I\u2019ve been sitting and watching for hours. \n\nThere is probably many more things that could be improved about Netflix, but these are the two suggestions I could think of and quickly type.",

They took out all of the good movies like Legally Blonde, Footloose, Mean Girls, Heathers, etc. and instead switched them out for a ton of bad Netflix originals. Don\u2019t get me wrong, some of them are okay, though the majority are movies with no plot and just overall boring. It\u2019s obviously cheaper for Netflix to just make their own movies, but what about entertainment wise? We want the good movies back, not the new ones Netflix filmed themselves. Often, I find myself scrolling though Netflix just to leave and go on another site to choose some other movie(s) to watch.

    "review": "This update is an improvement in many aspects, all the options are now on the bottom instead of scattered around the screen. The play button is now in the middle, making it easier and more satisfying to use. The removal of the 10-second rewind button is now really starting to get annoying though, because I want to rewatch a funny part of an episode, but now I have to manually move the dial and it moves it back like a minute behind. It gets to the point where I regret even moving it back because I forget what I even wanted to see. Bring back the rewind button, and add a fast forward button. That\u2019d be cool.",

Firstly, my \u201ccontinue watching\u201d tab is constantly moving making it aggravating to have to scroll to look for it. Just make it the first thing I see! Also, I dislike the fact that content plays automatically if you hover over it for too long. Most of the the time whatever is on the spotlight is not something I\u2019m remotely interested in watching. A little more customization on the home page would be appreciated. Lastly, going back to the old rating system would be appreciated. Sometimes a thumbs down is too harsh for a movie but giving it a thumbs up is no good either.",

I really don\u2019t understand. \u201cFriends\u201dwas probably the show that made Netflix the most money last year because so many people watch it, and I know that a very large amount of people watch \u201cThe Office\u201d, so that makes Netflix a huge amount of money as well. I really don\u2019t get the reason for taking off shows. Netflix: if your gonna take off these shows, GIVE US A REASON!!!! Please!

Okay on Netflix there are a lot of anime shows, but the problem is that most shows don\u2019t have all the episodes! I mean if you\u2019re gonna put an anime show on Netflix, at least add all the anime episodes! Another thing is that if you have an anime that will continue to another anime series, you should add it to Netflix! Example: (Naruto = Naruto Shippunden = Boruto) I also think that you should add more animes to Netflix.

Everything is much simpler to find (i.e. instead of all the romantic comedies being on your homepage, you can easily browse them in the search tab, love it!) and it has been great. However I\u2019m a little disappointed by things you have removed from the app. Fast forwarding by 10-30 seconds is much easier with a little button and I often have the need to do so.

Also, the \u201cHelp\u201d section consists of the phone number to customer service - not actually any help topics to read about and possibly find the solution yourself. You have to actually CALL someone, which is not always convenient. Why on earth would I want to go to a different platform to check my information when I could do it before on the app?

It\u2019s also good because it has anime with dub (English) and that\u2019s better than having to not understand anything if it doesn\u2019t have subtitles. Anyways if you don\u2019t want to spend money on this app then that\u2019s fine I\u2019m just saying if you want heaven to be on your side download this for the subscription and Netflix if your reading this can you make a whole anime section for weebs like me and add more?

I don\u2019t understand why it had to be so sad! SPOILER: why did you have to have a poison trap that KILLED June!? I am literally crying because of it! Why did you you have to make the trap poison! Why did two dogs have to die in this movie!? I know they that they adopt a new dog or two, ( I\u2019m pretty sure), but that doesn\u2019t make June dying any better Netflix!

It is because of Netflix blocking all users using VPNs. Due to many international copyright laws, citizens of other countries have a separate Netflix from US Residents. And many shows are blocked on their Netflix resulting in people illegally using VPNs to access the US Netflix selection. And people like me use VPNs for legal uses, like security or work cannot access Netflix. So many innocents are casualties of this war on illegal VPN users. So Netflix, are you going to continue to fight a battle that Will eventually lead to you losing customers, or are you lift the VPN ban. I will change my review when you do.",

Like in Australia y\u2019all have added Lucifer to the catalog but in the U.S you haven\u2019t added it at all tho!!! Could y\u2019all please add the first 3 seasons already so we can rewatch them and prep for when y\u2019all release season 4 since it is now a Netflix original??? Other than that, y\u2019all have a great app here"

And it\u2019s for the download section on the app. I don\u2019t fly too often, but when I do I like to have something to watch and I don\u2019t normally purchase the WiFi that the airlines offer. Well, I can\u2019t access my downloaded shows and movies when my phone is in airplane mode. I get that I could open the app and start the show or movie before I put my phone in airplane mode. But I\u2019m never going to remember to do that! I think it would be awesome if we could somehow access our downloads while in airplane mode."

On Disney+ I have access to the first one, but I have to wait until August 6,  2021. So many other amazing things got taken off, and I don\u2019t know why.

I\u2019ll be stuck with that for a while because I share a profile with a 5 year old) or a big category where they can barely watch ANYTHING because 75% or more is too inappropriate (happens to teens). \n\nYou should add a pre-teen and a teen category. That way, in case I get my own profile in a couple of years, I don\u2019t have to surf through baby shows. And the teens who sit through baby shows, same thing. Teens who aren\u2019t allowed to watch almost anything, same for them. \n\nI hope you add this, because a lot of people have requested it and so I can find something besides Zig and Sharko (I will die if my 5 year old sibling puts that on again. Get rid of it and she will cry for days) \n\nAnd, why did you have to remove the 90\u2019s DISNEY MOVIES?! I couldn\u2019t watch them until Disney Plus came out. \n\nI hope #3 in entertainment passes you, second place! \ud83d\ude1d"

It worked great before but now after a show is over it sends me back to my \"downloaded movies\" menu and won't let me watch anything els unless I restart my phone. Please help and get your next update out soon so I can give you 5 stars.\n\nThank you for fixing the bugs. My downloaded movies will play when I am out of cell coverage, my phone isn't burning hot while I watch downloaded movies. You fixed it. I'm back to loving this app."

Tried to sign in from my \u201cwelcome to netflix\u201d mail, the error turns to a \u201ctechnical issue\u201d error. I\u2019ve been trying to contact netflix for the last hour but I keep being told to try later. Not even 12 hours have passed since I subscribed to the service and I already regret it. Haven\u2019t felt that frustrated in a while, at least Netflix could be more informative about the error, and not tell me to try to sign in in a few minutes when that won\u2019t change anything. In conclusion, worst service I\u2019ve tried, I would never recommend it to anyone.",

    "review": "I have the top plan with NF. Multiple devices. My whole Family uses it constantly. However there are a few things that as a business owner and consumer drive me and my family nuts. \n\n1. Not all movies and shows are available. And I believe some algorithm is choosing for me which is fine, but it makes all my choices. My wife and kids have shows and movies I can\u2019t find and vice versa.\n\n2. We have an apple adapter and want to watch on tv as a family and when we plug it in to transfer the movie to the tv the sound is there but the picture isn\u2019t. I think this is intentional in the software because Apple is a competitor, but I could be wrong.\n\n3. Plus, there are way to many foreign films with terrible over dubs, I never watch them, but Netflix must think I love them...UGH\n\n4. The worst\n Is that I try to watch a show on NF and it drags and pixelates, but on ITunes I watch HD and it doesn\u2019t. \n\nI love NF, and would give it 5 stars all day, if they would get there programmers to kick the executives in the teeth and fix these things.",

I have nothing against movies from other countries but the \nquality in most of the movies on Netflix is nonexistent. If Netflix would just focus on continuing their successful endeavors and taking more time to release and bring better movies to their services...\n\nWe don\u2019t mind waiting for something great Netflix. What we do mind is having to dig through Netflix, and trying to find something good to watch. What we end up watching is something we\u2019ve seen a million times. \nA friend of mine watches nothing on Netflix but The Office, Stranger Things, and To all the boys I\u2019ve loved before. On repeat. \n\nWe are going to both pull away from our subscriptions unless you get rid of all the garbage floating around. And no NO ONE likes it.

No, they will forget mostly about the show and quite possibly not even try to watch the new season. Shows could possibly be shown weekly.

Sometimes the WiFi gets crappy and then like the second episode and fourth episode get skipped but everything else gets downloaded and I\u2019m like what the heck. Could y\u2019all put on an option that will download them in season order with priority downloading? Maybe like a queue list or something? Also an option that presents all the shows in a list for data\u2019s sake. Thanks in advance!",

If you don\u2019t have a channel or a different way to watch the show, then you have to wait until the whole season is over to watch it.\n 2: The ratings. Using the thumbs up or thumbs down method is very limiting. \n3: The movies are limited. Some movies seem to just take up space when Netflix can try to replace them with newer ones.\n4: The shows/movies don\u2019t flow through a cycle. When they take a show or movie off, it will most likely never come back. It would be cool if some could come back and just flow through a cycle.",

My parents don\u2019t think that the adult section is appropriate. Some of it is but then there is stuff that isn\u2019t. I just wish they made a teen section with PG and PG-13 t.v shows and movies. Now I\u2019m stuck with a little kid section. Every time I want to watch something PG-13 I have to ask my parents if I can watch it in their\u2019s. It\u2019s just frustrating. Please consider my suggestion. Thank you. Netflix is a great tool to watch things just needs improvement.",

Constant buffering on popular shows/movies, downloads so slow it's near impossible (if they don't cancel by themselves anyways).\n\nSure you could cut them some slack since it's prob server overload or something, but they had over a month to fix it and they don't cut anyone slack on their bill either.\n\nWould give minus one star because unless you have a US account, they randomly resort your list of saved movies almost daily to push their choices on you (mind you, not their recommendations, but a list YOU saved).

If you don\u2019t act fast enough it skips the end of the music and goes into another episode or even worse into another series. So you can\u2019t listen to the music and enjoy thinking about what you just saw. At the end of the crown you don\u2019t even have the choice to watch the credits and listen to the music. They throw you into some other series you don\u2019t even want to watch. How about giving us a choice Netflix?\n\nSlay the only feedback is via telephone so you get this feedback on the public review",

Guess we\u2019ll find out!\n\nOtherwise, I\u2019ve been a Netflix customer since DVDs were being shipped 100%. This is a great service. Cable is dead."

    "review": "I\u2019ve always loved his app but until today it\u2019s probably not gonna be like that anymore. I\u2019m sobbing as I write this for starters. As I just started to get into \u201cPretty Little Liars\u201d I was on Season 3 Ep. 8 or something but then right in the middle of when I\u2019m watching it. It says there was an ERROR and now whenever I type in \u201cPretty Little Liars\u201d it doesn\u2019t show up. So Netflix if you see this I hope you\u2019re proud that you just made a 12 year old girl cry. And for your information Netflix isn\u2019t the best on Earth..... but if they bring back \u201cPretty Little Liars\u201d maybe the universe will have a change in stars and heart."

It brings sadness, love, anger, comedy, suspense, and happiness all together. Stranger Things 3 was by far the best season!!!! There are a few things Netflix should work on. I feel like they should add movies and shows from an older time, because lots of people look for movies like that, and always seem to have to buy them or rent them somewhere else. They should also add a better variety of romance and horror movies, other than that, Netflix is great!",

I\u2019m currently watching the series \u201cBlack Butler\u201d and I\u2019m still waiting on season two. I\u2019ve been doing some research and found out that show has been on Netflix for a long time now and used to actually have season two. People mostly think Netflix has removed Black Butler 2 or the whole entire series just because Netflix hasn\u2019t renewed it's license for the show. So if that\u2019s the actual reason you don\u2019t give viewers the next episode or season to their favorite show, please renew your license.",

That movie was amazing and today I tried to watch it and I couldn\u2019t find it and then I searched it up on safari and it took me to Netflix where I did find it but was completely unable to play it.

It only felt necessary to give a 2 star review for the 2 seasons you gave us. you can earn the other stars by giving us the other 2 seasons and an extra star for listening to this review. Thank you for  your time, Netflix. I hope you carefully consider taking this up as an option and opportunity to get more people to watch Netflix. love y\u2019all \ud83d\ude18",

I hate it so much it\u2019s so annoying, u act like Netflix is going to shut my tv off or something by asking if I\u2019m still watching I feel like that\u2019s the dumbest thing ever ,, that needs to be changed ,",

Also I don\u2019t like that Netflix takes off shows to add new ones, now I understand that you have to make room for the new ones but I loved to watch shera and Jem and the holograms on Netflix and the next day that I went on it Netflix took both shows off. I know they were old cartoons but some people did like them. Hope you enjoyed my problem list lol bye",

I know you guys are trying to go for more original content but you keep taking away all the shows I used to watch. It no longer informs me about new seasons of shows I have in my follow list unless they are Netflix originals. Last of all when it shows recommended movie/tv shows after you finish one it only recommends Netflix originals it doesn't matter that you just finished watching That 70s show, it recommends you watch True and the Rainbow Kingdom (Netflix original). Honestly why change something that worked well.",

And now I\u2019m just realizing it\u2019s changed back!? Idk if it\u2019s just my phone but it\u2019s better the other way with the big play button in the middle of the screen. Before all the time I would rewind by accident instead of pausing or playing the movie!! Welp that\u2019s it\nPs. Idk if the company is going to see this  or just for people to download the app or not.......",

If I click back to it to maximize it it\u2019s too late to read it. If I rewind a bit to try and read the cast credits, it shrinks agaiiiiin! I know not everyone likes credits but some do and it should at least be an option to see them.  I do pay for the entire movie or episode...not a portion of it, right? Is Netflix getting too big to care about the viewer experience and only the $$? ...and this issue is not affected by turning off auto play of next episode.",

Tried to start the app to watch on the plane, but the app doesn\u2019t even start without Internet connection! Just keeps saying \u201cError connecting to network\u201d. So I paid $10 for Internet for an hour. This way, I could watch one movie. When trying to start the next one, again it didn\u2019t work as the app needed to reconnect to the Internet for whatever reason. Didn\u2019t want to pay another $10. Very frustrating.\nNote that after a downloaded movie has started, no Internet connection is required, but to start the movie, it is. False advertising.",

Although a trailer might give you some insight to the story line, some of the tv shows and movies included on Netflix don\u2019t  have a trailer. In my opinion, this feature shouldn\u2019t have been removed and hopefully will be reinstalled in the near future.",

One is the forced price increases, and most importantly the organization is terrible. Its like sorting through a 50 gallon tub of $5 movies at the store terrible. Please please please.... when you go to the \"new movies\" or \"recently added\" selections order the movies from the most recently added and newest to the oldest!!! I also would like \"My list\" to be that way because its common sense and easy to locate what you want.",

Now, most recently, I'm getting movies I definitely don't want to watch like Below My Mouth or The L Word. They are insulting, don't have plots and I'm just not interested. I like love stories, romantic comedy, movies with animals, dogs mostly. I don't have small children any more so Disney movies don't interest me either. Come on Netflix , you can do better.

    "review": "This is an amazing app! I\u2019ve been using this app for so many years! There are tons of TVs shows and movies to watch! Although it might be great...there is one minor issue. Some of the shows on Netflix only have 1 or 2 seasons when there are more seasons to the show. For example my little sister was watching flowering heart but she was so upset because there was only one of the two seasons. This is the only problem that needs to be solved in my opinion. Overall, this is a great app!",

Love the huge selection, and how you can rate what you like then it will give you a percentage of the movie of how much you would like it. Great app \ud83e\udddc\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

I\u2019m really thinking of just terminating my subscription which I did get the most premium one but it\u2019s not worth it.

Take \u201cThe Ranch\u201d for example, one of the very few series that had good humor for the right, but had to end the series with everyone going left and being unamerican. Why? Why does every show now have to bombard us with propaganda that goes against our constitution, or have to have some social justice issue tied into it. Just make shows, that\u2019s your job, it\u2019s entertainment, not to sway the masses with your thoughts on every issue. I find it very irresponsible from Netflix to use their platform as a propaganda tool. It will only lose you business. Good luck.",

I have to have something on when falling asleep \ud83d\udca4, but can\u2019t use the Netflix because it stops. I wonder if the nice Netflix people could make a setting to turn on/ off continuous play for those of us that would use it?  Other than that Thank you Netflix.",

    "review": "I love Netflix to death but there serious problems with some shows/movies that ruins the experience on the newer iPhones with OLED screens. On darker scenes in particular, shading seems to be completely thrown into the trash and instead just goes straight to black and this creates scenes of nearly all black with hardly any details. Also, if there are brighter scenes but there\u2019s shading in that scene, it can sometimes turn that area into plain black, again disregarding any types of shading. It totally ruins the experience of Netflix on the mobile app.",

This seems deliberate.  \n\nLately, downloaded videos aren\u2019t playing with an error msg saying it\u2019s not available offline. Even when I just downloaded them a day or two before trying to watch and I can go back and download them again. Don\u2019t trust your downloaded videos will be watchable offline."

There should be a place where all you watched movies could be located and a symbol on the title that shows that it has been viewed\n2. There should also be a way to give better rating on the movies and a place that you can look at all your ratings\n3. There should be the same shows in every place in the world. Everytime I Tavel\nI find movies on Netflix that I had never seen before and when I get home they are available anymore, I think that it\u2019s annoying to know that other places can have shows that you want to watch\n4. There is also a problem with the movie selection, the Disney princess movies are not on there and neither are the marvel movies, which are some of the most popular movies in our generation.",

The most important (and annoying!) to me is that the peripheral vision when you increase the size of the screen shrinkens, which means that some of the pictures are cropped on the sides which gets really annoying especially when there are words on the screen that get chopped off. I am hoping that Netflix will fix it because it is really annoying and there are other minor glitches, but otherwise I love this app!"

It did an automatic update about 3 days ago. Can't you people test your apps on older platforms before you release it. Your big enough. I hate it that apps are only tested on the newest platforms, assuming it will work on older platforms, and disregarding long time customers. My iPad has a newer iOS than 9.0."

However, one of the greatest joys was families being able to share this, and college kids who maybe have a tight budget could all share this.\n\nThe industry has now been flooded with everyone wanting their own streaming service now, fighting over rights and titles. Most people will not pay for all the various subscriptions.\n\nAmongst this level of competition Netflix has become more greedy with their policies. First raising prices all the time making it the most expensive service, and then again \u201ccracking down\u201d on password sharing.\n\nI cancelled my service. If I cannot share something with my friends and family it is not worth paying for. I hope others will follow my lead so Netflix realizes how foolish, greedy, and sleazy this move really is."

It seems that every other update completely removes My List (as in \u2018click the link and get an empty page with a suggestion that you start adding shows\u2019) and the Continue Watching section. Then, hopefully, the next update returns them. It\u2019s a real rollercoaster with Netflix. \n\nAfter the most recent update, both My List and Continue... are MIA. I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I seriously hesitate to update the app just in case it will remove those sections. \n\nThere\u2019s also the eternal problem with Netflix showing you stuff their algorithm decides you would like, while making it a real chore finding the things you actually want. But, that\u2019s a problem with almost all streaming services."

A recent update on the mobile app also dropped the synopsis of movies/shows and replaced them with \u2018search tags\u2019 (ie an actor\u2019s name or other key adjectives). Worst update ever IMO.

If there\u2019s a way to make the watch experience less pleasant, or navigation in the app more baffling, you can expect it to show up in an upcoming update. Don\u2019t get me started with the auto-play trailers on the TV app which will quickly teach you never to click on a show you aren\u2019t absolutely sure about or delay in starting a title. \n\nSeriously, this amount of user hostility must be intentional. Complete UX ignorance would produce a better app. Even the update release notes come off as passive aggressive. Ugh!",

And add clean movies I hate it when I start watching a movies then there is disgusting stuff halfway through it. Maybe add Shazam or even the new Robin Hood. Heck add good Halloween movies so I can watch it through vidangel so it is clean. PLEASE!!!!!!!!!",

Like it\u2019s hard to find shows I\u2019d enjoy watching because some of them are in the kids and others are in the adult section. But other than that is a nice app to watch movies and shows on!",

They want you to flounder around looking at a bunch titles you don't want to watch instead of watching the ones you actually do want to watch. Why Netflix, do you keep making things less appealing? I also liked that you could see the 5-star ratings for a movie and you just turned it into a dumb \"thumbs up/down\", which doesn't help and makes the selection you show an individual more narrow. Bring back My List!",

I don\u2019t know if this is on purpose or on accident, but I just wanted to say something about it.",

    "review": "I have had Netflix for a while and have come to love the app, but I have a couple of suggestions. My first one being that I dislike the subtitles appearing yellow. It\u2019s very distracting to viewing the show/movie. Additionally I like that you can just tap now to forward or rewind 10 seconds but wish it didn\u2019t appear so big on the screen when you go to hit the pause button. Other than those two complaints Netflix should keep up the good work",

It\u2019s now possible to skip forwards ten seconds as well as back, and both can be done by double tapping the screen. The volume is now a nice discreet bar at the top of the screen instead of the enormous iphone default volume graphic covering the middle of the video.\n\nIt also looks like the horrible autoplay ads on the home page may be gone for good. I haven\u2019t seen any for weeks. I\u2019m very happy about that.\n\nThanks! I love it!",

It proves who is grown as everyone who watches Shrek shows who is mature as we learned valuable lessons with Shrek and his crew.

But it\u2019s okay if you guys don\u2019t do that but please! Huro is annoying!!! Thanks! Oh and I ship Juno and legoshi! I think they a are really cute together! So yeah thx!!",
