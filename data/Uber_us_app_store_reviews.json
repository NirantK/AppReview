    "review": "I heard so many good stories about people using Uber and being pleased with its service, but when my wife and I reached Los Angeles and decided to use it I found out the harsh reality. Unfortunately, Uber has become a master of deception using its large user base to suggest confidence, but after getting a quote for a little over 40 dollars, my wife and I ended up getting charged almost 100 dollars because of difference in \u201ctime\u201d and \u201cdistance.\u201d I would be fine if that were the truth, but instead we had a driver that wasn\u2019t focused and missed his exit, then his phone died and we had to use our own phones to guide him. This resulted in us having to drive another 30 minutes just because their own driver didn\u2019t plan ahead or pay attention to the road. I will NEVER use Uber again because the only thing they did to \u201cfix\u201d the problem was give me 5 Uber bucks without any notification and then ignore any requests sent via app to find a proper resolution. So much for customer \u201csupport.\u201d\n                    UPDATE\nAfter a few days of trying to find out how to talk with support staff directly I was able to reach a satisfying solution. I believe the best way to avoid situations like this would be to make the app send a notification when support staff message you, instead of you having to dig and find out where to talk to them. Because of their understanding I may use Uber again, but just be wary about knowing where to contact anyone in case of a bad ride.",

For starters the seller fees are absolutely ridiculous! I should not have to be charged for my drivers errors. I have had numerous occasions of being charged a $5 fee for my driver not being able to find my house. Which brings me to my next problem. \n\nThe GPS navigation they have going is a mess. My old house was a difficult yet not impossible location to find. The u-turn by the gas station was right by the driveway to my house which is easy to miss. However I have tried contacting my Uber drivers giving them guidance. Some still ended up canceling. I have had drivers that would decide it was better to take a longer way for certain places rather than back ways and shortcuts. That also makes everything 10 times  worse, because I have been late to work even scheduled ahead of time since these problems with your system have occurred. \n\nI\u2019m also currently disabled and can\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t drive, because of it. However I can\u2019t blame Uber for being late for work even though it most certainly is. I take my job seriously so apparently I need to go back to Lyft since I haven\u2019t had any of these issues personally. They even found my house in the dark!

They literally won\u2019t give out a number to call or email, and as far as I can see online, they literally don\u2019t have one (even though their website currently says they do give you the number), or if they do they\u2019ve done a great job of making it very unintuitive to find. What they do is, give you a preset list of 4 or 5 possible issues you may have with a specific ride (so no complaints if 5 drivers in a row cancel right before they are at your location). If you click on the thing from the list they just run your trip through some automated program that determines if you get your money back. My most recent incident my driver took a terrible route, then took two wron turns, adding 30 minutes to what was originally estimated to be a 30 minute trip total, and the navigation app he was using said it would be another 30 minutes. At that point it was literally quicker to walk the last 1 \u00bd miles. So I got out and walked, but it shows up as me having completed the trip, so whether I select driver took poor route or trip was too long, it just spits out an answer based on incomplete information. Clear lack of effort on their part, luckily for me they have competitors that care about the customer experience more then they do.",

Today in the heat I was counting on getting Uber to take my little dog to the vet. They charge extra for the dog which is ok. But the app is now so messed up that I was unable to change the pickup point or my destination. There was no way to do it so I had to drag my puppy in this heat and had great difficulty breathing walking to the vet with a mask on. This is nonsense.  Also it\u2019s screwed up for drivers because they changed the pop up I used to see after the ride. Now I have to go to past trips up in the left corner to search for the trip and then add the tip. I was totally unable to select 5 stars for the driver. How many people are going to bother to do all this when it\u2019s money they could save. This is one more proof of how Uber has little regard for their riders or drivers.   To all apps:  Stop filling in the blanks with what you think I want to do or where I want to go. You are creating a mess and proving we have nothing to worry about from artificial intelligence yet.   The app worked months ago but stop making it so smart that it\u2019s unusable.",

Routinely, the app says, for example, it will take 3 minutes to be picked up so, i request ride. But as soon as a driver confirms pickup, the time until pickup becomes a lot longer. And regardless of the pickup time listed, 9 of 10 times it takes considerably longer for the driver to arrive. I can\u2019t tell If this is an app or driver problem or both.  Regarding the app, it looks to me like bait and switch. Get me to select a ride with short pickup time, and suddenly after selecting the ride double it or more. And even the extended time is wrong and the driver takes longer to arrive. This problem continues to worsen.  I also now sometimes see drivers not responding to rides, at least on the app. On the driver location, I\u2019ll see a driver sit without moving for minutes before coming to get me. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a problem with the app or the driver accepting a ride and taking his to time before coming to get me. This happened at an airport pickup last night again. I walked past the cabs because it showed a 3 minute pickup time But actial pickup was 10 min and i could have practically been home already in the taxi. For the first 5 min the driver sat where he was when he accpeted to ride. I need reliability.",

I am not happy with UBER trying several times to direct me to another pickup point in the pouring rain. Why did UBER expect me to got to a more \"convenient pick up point\" which was only more convenient for the driver, not the passenger. Not a good thing to make me waste my time with such foolishness. The UBER drivers are getting paid for picking up a passenger wherever he or she is currently located and taking them to wherever it is they need to go.  If UBER was trying to make improvements to their service this is \"NOT\" the way to do that in my opinion, just saying.",

    "review": "The driver's app must be broken as uber seems to feel the need to call the rider and ask them where they are and where they're going. Perhaps, the drivers aren't able to see what the customer has typed, the map, the address, gps, the live blue dot and the live symbolic car that represents the car that the uber driver is driving. Those all must be buggy as well.  Maybe, the maps are incorrect, too? The drivers can't seem to use gps and a live location from the passenger (blue dot) to find where they're going or where the passenger is waiting. \nRating system has problems as well. Star ratings can't be used to choose a driver. If the driver accepts and he or she has a low rating, you can cancel, but expect to pay the penalty fee. Driver's cancel all the time, but are not charged a fee. Perhaps a system error is to blame as no one would chose an arbitrary rating system except an old tv show where the points don't matter. \nFinal app issue: wait times. When the app says, five minutes away, it really means 12-15 minutes away. You can cancel, but your credit card will be charged each and every time unless you dispute the charge. Maybe, it's supposed to be like that? Seems counterintuitive, and unlike a similar app that doesn't have incorrect wait times, penalties for customers and an arbitrary rating system where the points don't matter. The drivers on that app just do their job and silently come to the blue dot.",

(Example: no left turn allowed onto 8th Avenue going east on 14th street - this is my typical pickup location and the driver usually has to spend 5 minutes driving around the block unless I text him to meet me elsewear). The other problem which is a recent one that has happened the past 2 days is that I get matched with a very convenient driver, walk to the pickup location very happily and then they cancel. The next drivers (multiple) I am matched with are extremely far away (up to 10 minutes) and I am forced to cancel and get into a yellow cab because I am now late.  Drivers should not be able to cancel when they are that close to picking up their rider, especially with uber pool where that person has most likely walked decently far to get there.",

It involves meeting your Uber at a determined location, this is very good and an excellent way to mainstream the process and make it more efficient.\nBut unfortunately the AI in control of matching the rider with the Uber seems to be based on distance away from the rider instead of actual logistics.\nThis is a problem for me since my pickup spots are always near an highway/expressway on street level (BQE in NYC) and the Ubers that are matched to me are always traveling on said expressway instead of on the side streets. Because of this, I've been matched with multiple Ubers that are traveling on the expressway and who's nearest exit is 30 minutes away. Due to this fact I couldn't even cancel the Uber since I would be charged a 5 dollar fee for due to the driver having to drive past me. \nThis leaves me with 3 options either take the 5 dollar fee and call another Uber or to call the driver and ask them to cancel the pick-up. Wait an extra half-hour for an uber. The 2nd option is often met with hostility with some drivers, and the 3rd option is just not feasible due to the driver having to drive back and then drop you off adding an extra hour to the commute. \nPlease take a look at this problem as it is extremely frustrating to book an Uber only to be late and frustrated at the process.",

When you request a ride it tells you the least amount of time you will wait but when it finds you a ride its 9minutes away. This morning alone I had to cancel 3 trips because they were more than 7 minutes away and by the 4th request an Uber was just 2minutes away. Why couldnt I get matched with the closest uber first?? Then my next problem and probably the worst is the Uber\u2019s navigation. One example was a trip i took from the bronx to Yonkers and the navigation led the Uber all the way downtown to 138th street to then loop us around to go uptown to 231st. How? When I could look at the GPS and find several other routes that were quicker and less of a hassle. And finally, i want to mention that i dont even use the pool option anymore because it feels like taking the bus. I sat in a pool once and before I got to my stop we picked up and dropped off 4 other people. I wouldnt have minded if it was on the way to my destination but it was so out of the way I considered getting out and taking the bus.

I put it in the Uber app, and it showed around $40, I thought it must be really far. Looking at the map, it showed kilometers. Then I noticed it was showing the cost in pesos. I had no idea how far it really was, or what it would charge me in American currency. SUCH A PAIN. The ride ended up being not so far, and only around $3 American. Then the top popped up, I clicked on $5 thinking it was a couple of dollars. Later my daughter figures it out and tells me that the $5 only ended being like twenty four cents. I felt so bad. UBER really needs to make a setting that you can choose what you want your miles/kilometers and currency to show.

Then the wait times for the ride is getting longer and longer. The drivers take longer than estimated pick up time. I fly every week and the decline in service is very noticeable. Not to mention the fees keep going higher and higher. Uber is getting worse than taxis. At least with taxis I don\u2019t have to walk unreasonably long distance and wait for the driver. One more thing, Atlanta airport installed heating lamps in the Uber pick up area, which is the most idiotic thing to do in 90 degree weather. \n\nFurthermore, more and more Uber drivers install obnoxious air refresheners that are overwhelming and headaches inducing. Can Uber develop air refreshener policy. Because if I cancel the ride based on smelly car then Uber will charge me cancellation fee - not fair. Taxis don\u2019t do that. If I don\u2019t like the quality of taxi then I don\u2019t get in without paying fees.",

    "review": "I would like to address the false advertising on the Uber app for pricing. I understand that when ordering an uber that the timing is what determines the price, however, for the scheduling an uber option, there should be more clarification on how much the price can range. Giving a price range that only shows a 7 dollar price difference does not encapsulate how much the uber can actually be. Also, not only that, but when you schedule an uber, you are not allowed to see the actual price of the ride until AFTER you take it. If I schedule an uber that ranges from $13-$17, I expect the ride to be around that price then, maybe even a little higher, but not much more than that. There should be an option to see the actual price when the driver is on his or her way because if it is going to be too expensive, I would rather cancel it and pay the cancellation fee than pay an absurd fare. If I schedule an uber some time in advance, I should realistically be able to see the price of it when the driver is on the way so it is fair. It is not ethical to have the app designed this way with no way of seeing the real fare of a scheduled uber before taking it. I have not had any other issues with this service except for the lack of this quintessential feature. Also I won\u2019t mention the lack of customer support... I can\u2019t even email Uber a complaint.",

I understand there is a wait time charge if the Uber driver arrives and they are obviously kept waiting but recently quite often the Uber driver can be at the corner of my block stating it arrives soon and I\u2019m waiting outside and at the end of my trip I see there is a charge for wait time. How can that be if I was ready and they weren\u2019t even in front of the pick up location. Or I\u2019ve have a few times where the driver states it\u2019s here but they aren\u2019t at the correct pick up even though I put the address and they are a few buildings away and then I have to walk to them and that causes them to start charging a wait time fee. Not sure if that is their GPS issue but it\u2019s annoying. Just the other day I requested an Uber and I was outside and the driver instead of heading straight which is where I was he drove around the block before arriving to me and then headed my way, mind you there was no traffic or others cars there for him giving him reason to go around the block. And what do you know I was charged a wait time fee. This is very frustrating and I have reached out to support which they have helped but it\u2019s annoying to constantly be going thru support. I hate to be that type of person that always has a complaint but they need to address this issue .",

    "review": "For the past months that I've been using the uber app I thought it was an okay app. Sometimes the drivers would say they're on their way in 5 minutes and then magically be 14 minutes away forcing me to cancel & search for someone else. Leaving me not being able to rate that driver & let him know what an inconvenience he has caused me. Also, normally you would be able to cancel your ride free of charge if your driver was more than 5 minutes away, today my driver was 13 minutes away, I cancelled because I was in too much of a hurry & was still charged $5. I'm extremely OVER this app, I will begin to use my local TLC driver companies from now on since they so conveniently make you comfortable ordering their vehicles and they actually give you real life people experiences even when you\u2019ve been inconvenienced. I also have had drivers lie about their vehicles that they\u2019ve been traveling in but because the license plate matched then I had to ride in that vehicle. Reaching out to Uber has become a joke because they purposefully make you feel like you\u2019re the problem and their well within their means to do and have drivers do as they please. The support at Uber has become nonexistent and they\u2019re prices have increased so dramatically that I should basically buy my own vehicle and pay my own gas and insurance, it would be so much cheaper. I\u2019m just so over the issues that I\u2019ve been experiencing with Uber for months now.",

However, I see all sorts of issues with the way the app works.  I\u2019d love to be able to provide this feedback to them in the app and help them improve and avoid several situations where they\u2019ve been unintentionally making it more difficult to use.   There is no way to contact Uber to let them know these things.  As a result there have been issues that have existed for years and create annoyance on a weekly basis.  This is not the type of customer centric experience I\u2019d expect.   One of many examples.  When booking a ride to the Atlanta airport, the app only displays the first characters.  These are Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson... then it gets cut off before being able to select the only information that really matters - which terminal?  As a result, ever ride defaults to the international terminal.  Every passenger and every driver I\u2019ve talked with about this has experienced the same problem.  I\u2019m sure this happens thousands of times a day.   Probably worth the minute it would take to fix this.  This App Store feedback is the only way I\u2019ve found to actually communicate this to Uber.  That\u2019s just scratching the surface.  My suggestion is that Uber actually figure out a way to pay attention to and act on their customers suggestion.",

Sometimes it gives you the option to pay almost $2 more to get a door-to-door service which makes it about the same price of getting an UberX so it loses the purpose of booking a Pool. I remember when you just initiated the new UberPool system, you told customers that it will decrease prices. What we actually got is the same prices for having to walk to get an UberPool which doesn\u2019t bring you on time to where you need to get. Driver arrival times are misleading, destination arrival times are misleading, and us customers just keep cooperating with inflating prices while the service we actually get is worse. It would be more fair if at least we customers could now upfront that we get worse service and have the option of reaching a better decision whether we should call an UberX or a Pool. If the ETA of the driver is said to be 9 min, it cannot arrive in 20min (assuming he didn\u2019t have any unexpected obstacles in his route) and if the ETA to your destination on a Pool is a window of 20min but it actually takes 40min to get to your destination, you should notify the rider upfront on the actual time window of arrival so he can reach a smart decision whether he wants to use the service or not. \nWe want the old UberPool back and we want honest ETAs.",

    "review": "Uber is not a bad service, but I think the rating system needs to be done away with, or at least used more judiciously, for a number of reasons. The judgement of the drivers (as well as the quality of their service) can sometimes be hit or miss. For example, I had a driver yell at me for asking him to lower the radio. Nine times out of ten co-riders couldn't care less so I figured it was ok to ask him. After passive-aggressively avoiding my request this guy goes on a tirade on how he leaves it on for the customers and how it's his therapy or something like that. \n\nIt's frustrating for me to see my rating go down on account of driver's who report anonymously. If my performance as a passenger really was such a big deal, drivers can just report me and take it up with management, but as it stands, there is no clear criteria as to what constitutes good \"5 star\" conduct. I do my utmost to be on time, courteous, and forgiving towards drivers who give less than a professional performance. The fact that there are drivers out there who can't reciprocate and who go out of their way to rate me lower just goes to show, as far as my judgement is concerned, that the drivers on this app need to be held more accountable to their customers and their employers.",

Not anymore. They moved the pickup area!!!!  It was raining and cold. I had gone to the original pickup sight to catch my ride. The pickup area had changed. Now I\u2019m running with my bags and other things in the cold and rain trying to get to the new spot. I\u2019m letting the driver know I wasn\u2019t aware the location had changed and I was on my way to the new location and would arrive very shortly. I received a notification my driver had cancelled my ride. I got to the new location right after receiving the notice. VERY UPSET, TIRED AND WET. He chose to cancel me and pickup someone already there. Well here\u2019s the devastation. I had to request another driver to get home. So now I\u2019m paying the actual driver who took me home and discovered I\u2019m paying the driver who cancelled me as well.  TWO CHARGES. That\u2019s ridiculous when I was Minutes away. As for the driver it is easy to pickup someone standing there knowing you\u2019re going to get compensated for both. A charge from me plus a charge plus tip from the driver you pickup. Not happy with Uber. Will look into LYFT\u2019s customer service rules and driver ethics. If you didn\u2019t know this now you do. Uber can cancel a customer, charge a fee for the driver and leave you having to start the process over again and pay again.",

Five stars for this ride to the public transportation center of the city. \nWhen we arrived back at the Brisbane Transit Center three day later and needing a ride to the residence, we again contacted Uber. We described where were, under a very large sign stating Brisbane Transportation Center including it\u2019s street address. We got a text from our driver to verify location, and we agin texted our location, address, and location under the very large sign at the entrance to the transit center. Three days earlier we had been dropped off about 30 meters from where we stood on the same side of the same street by the first Uber driver. The potential driver responded with a thumbs up. The app indicated he was less than a minute away. He called a moment later and my wife again explained to the driver our location. My wife said he was difficult to understand. After about 15 minutes of waiting we got the Uber cancellation notice. We called someone else (not Uber) who spoke English and new exactly where we were. Five stars to someone besides Uber.",

I have used the passenger app myself and i can attest to the fact that the color and picture of the vehicle along with the license plate are so miniaturized that they are difficult to see. Not to mention people with visual disabilities and color blindness will find it even harder to know what color car is picking them up. I\u2019ve had new users show me the app and i have had to explain to them how to navigate and see the driver\u2019s details including type and color of the car. From a passenger\u2019s stand point, it would be most helpful the screen is divided into rows; right side for the map and left side for the name, vehicle type, color and license plate or vice versa in block letters for easy visibility. Also it needs to say what color instead of showing the color. For passenger\u2019s whose phone battery is running low while they wait for the driver to show up, the constant use of location service which is a battery killer should be changed to maybe every 1 minute for example if the driver is 7 minutes away from being constant. This will help the passenger as well as the driver as it will post the most accurate and recently updated location.",

Uber informed me that the ride was 2 minutes away, but after waiting 10 minutes, the app had only gone up 6 minutes to a total of 8 minutes away. This compelled me to contact the driver, who was extraordinarily rude. This uber was extraordinarily unprofessional, had more than one of her own friends in the car, and talked to me in a condescending way when asking if she was alright and would prefer for me to find another ride. She then continued to drive away and lengthen the time of pickup after responding to me \u201cwe good you\u2019ll be straight\u201d after asking if she was okay and whether she\u2019d prefer me to calm another ride. Because of the unfriendly system of the uber app, I was never able to contact the company in order to report the driver, while it was a major annoyance for me, it wasn\u2019t the end of the world. But I want to report this driver for being unprofessional and Uber does not give the opportunity to do that, the app does not support the customers or even try to. Use lift whenever you can.",

There is no number to call to get their \u201c24/7\u201d live calls with someone from customer support either. I looked it up through google and it was just an automated message that hung up. Even on their website, i asked for help and all they had was use the help section in the app and click this link.. there was no such link.  I did get to send a message through the app asking why was my total changed or updated. I only got an automated response that was no use. \nTotally disappointed and feel cheated.

A few incidents I recall quite well was one where a driver drove past my location and to the destination without ever picking me up and then reported the job as completed. Another when the driver cancelled the drive mid route when he hit traffic , and then the support teams response was \u201c If a trip is cancelled for any reason you still must pay the cancellation fee\u201d and after that debacle and arguing they eventually refunded me, and lastly was when I had a flat and parked and ordered an Uber to come pick me up - my driver only spoke Spanish and was driving around my location but not getting to it. I sent her a description of my location to help which she presumably could not read because she responded \u201cI\u2019m here\u201d in Spanish after opening the messages and being no where near the mapped location. Then I responded to her the same description but in Spanish ,which she read, and then promptly cancelled the ride. Then I had to fight with customer service for a full refund.

The first time the gift card paid for my half and the second time the gift card should have paid for my half and then another payment method cover the remainder. On the second ride, my sister (who had also received a $20 gift card) was able to use what was left of her gift card balance and her backup payment method was charged the remainder. My backup method paid the entire trip and my gift card balance was not used. When I submitted a request for Uber to look into this, I was told that you have to purchase more Uber cash to use the remainder of the gift card. This would not be a big deal if my sister - who in the exact same situation - would have had to have purchased Uber cash to use hers. Obviously this is a lie since it worked for her. I was then told that due to my issue my gift card balance would be refunded to me and to provide a mailing address. After a month had passed I followed up on this and was told that I cannot get a refund for my gift card and the prior employee had lied. Now, I am being told the same story that you have to purchase Uber cash to use a partial gift card which is back to the same lie I was told in the beginning and can prove wrong based on my sister\u2019s half of our shared receipt.

The Uber app itself was very easy to use, the fares were very reasonable and the drivers were very friendly and understanding (for the most part). Unfortunately, although Uber was my go to ridesharing app, there became a time when I was charged a different amount for a trip in which I had paid the amount fully beforehand (the fare was shown and I agreed to pay with my personal debit card). I was shown a price upfront of $7 and later I received a notification from my bank that I was charged $33 from Uber in which I was very confused and a bit fustrated. I tried reaching out to Uber Support upon their app, but it was a painful experience. The messaging system itself is automated so I received the same response over and over without much help. It asked me to pay the \u201cOutstanding Balance\u201d on my account in which I did, first using a relatives card and later my girlfriends. Yet even then, my account still read \u201coutstanding balance\u201d and BOTH my girlfriend and relative were charged the $30 with my account still being blocked. I then decided to simply delete the app but Uber did not allow me to delete it. I now cannot use the Uber app and I am completely blocked away.

This is tricky because the app stresses checking the license plate before getting in the car, but if the ride has started, then I can\u2019t confirm the make/model of the car and the license plate. As a single woman hoping into stranger\u2019s cars, I like being able to confirm that I\u2019m riding with the right person before entering their car. Could you please provide guidance to drivers not to start a ride before the person gets in the car (ideal option) or add car info so that it is easily accessible once a ride has started so that if they do, I can still confirm I\u2019m in the right car (back-up option)? It would definitely make me feel better being able to confirm, especially now that the app pushes confirmation of license plates so much."

The rider had to verbally direct me. Then I spent five minutes fixing the app. Now support is 7 emails deep even though I literally told them everything, sent screen shots proving the ride (a habit I am now in because of the app). It should have been a $4 ride for the user and $3 for me but they charged the user $0, then $13, and now $5 in 24 hours because they can't read the details I've sent now three times (pick up, drop off, time, miles and even did all the math for them).

One time you gave me 3 drivers (kicking off the first two) that made me wait for more than 30 minutes to finally picked me up. The thing is, you kick off my previous driver after you made me wait that long and he is just a minute away. And you didn\u2019t even compensate my wasted time and no promotions at least to compensate me. You only gave $2 compensation when the driver arrives late (from your estimated ETA) at the destination. I am going to work. What excuse do i give my boss? That the Uber app is unreliable?

Toward what should have been the end of my ride, we picked up another rider. The GPS was directing the driver to drop off the other rider first, which would mean going past my stop. After having been in the car for about 40 minutes (usually 25 by pool at most) I was ready to get out, so I asked the driver to stop and let me out. The driver ignored me and kept driving. He headed further away from my stop, so I sat there stunned that he didn't let me out and not wanting to get dropped off even farther from my house. He went past the other rider's stop and had to get turned around to drop me off. I told the driver exactly where to stop and he went past it. I said just stop here and his car kept moving, so I yelled, let me out! Stop the car. He stopped and I got out. I wrote to customer support and their response had nothing to do with the fact that I felt unsafe but rather the perils of taking pool. I thought it was a joke. They explained my fare would not be adjusted. It's not about the fare! Let people out of the car when they want to get out! I will not being using uber anymore. I felt trapped and uncomfortable. My genuine concern was met with an automated response. Glad to know nothing about uber had changed. The safety of their riders is not a priority."

    "review": "I love the idea of ride share like Uber or Lyft. Sometimes it\u2019s way more affordable than cabs. However, I have not had a good experience with Uber. Over two years ago I was in NYC and was waiting for the driver forever who never came so I had to cancel the ride and wait for another driver. Got charged some fees which after some digging for customer service (since they make it so inaccessible) I was refunded in the form of store credit. Well years go by I try to log in to my account and it asks me for the first six digits of my card and there is no way to overcome that step to log in. My card expired years ago! Was I supposed to hold on to it? Anyway, now I\u2019m unable to log in to my account and when i send the message to them it asks me to verify my email by clicking on the link sent to my email otherwise they won\u2019t process my request. Cool. Well when I click on the link the server is down so I cannot verify my email so my messages to support aren\u2019t going through. I cannot log in to my account or create a new one because it is the same phone number and there is no phone number  to contact them. Thank god there is Lyft. Even though it is a little pricier than Uber, I guess you get what you paid for. Honestly, Uber was cool when it was the only app , now there are so many alternatives so if I were you , go with a better alternative. Uber went downhill :/"

    "review": "I feel that Uber should change the age limit for Ubers. Some parents send their children in Uber/lyfts because they do not have transportation. By changing the age limit to ride in a Uber causes kids to NOT have any transportation and to not be safe outside in the cold without a ride/walking in the dark. You are also putting their lives in danger because the ride was already ordered and they have no way to get home. Uber DOES show the location on where you are at anytime. Uber DOES show how to share your location as WELL AS A SAFETY MODE. Uber does all these things for adults why can\u2019t they do it for children(teenagers) too? They are still making more money AND WHEN YOU REFUSE THE RIDE YOU CHARGE $5.00. If you are going to charge $5 as a cancellation fee you might as well just allow them to ride. It\u2019s also wasting time when the Uber driver IS ALREADY THERE then refuses the ride due to being a minor. I don\u2019t think children should be allowed to make an account but be able to get in a ride to get home. I\u2019m not saying \u201cdon\u2019t take Uber\u201d but I feel that some of their rules are unfair. \u201cWe will Uber to your place. Be right there.\u201d Yeah you\u2019re right there but you\u2019re refusing me a ride home. I don\u2019t think anyone under 10 should be getting in the car with a stranger but TEENAGERS. From 13 to beyond should be allowed to ride in Ubers. So they have a place to go and the parents won\u2019t be worried."

I ordered an uber to get to work just like I do every other day with 30 mins to spare to get to work on time (it only takes 12-15) mins to get to my job) once I got matched with a driver it let me know the ETA was 2 minutes. well first of all the uber driver could not figure out how to get to my location he did so many rounds by the entrance but never thought that\u2019s where he should go I messaged him through the app to explain a little better that\u2019s the entrance he should go through but disregards it then he finally calls me (this is already 10 mins into me requesting an uber) and asks where to go I talk him through it and says ok I\u2019ll be there in a minute again he does two rounds but doesn\u2019t go into the street I told him to another 5 minutes pass and finally I see his suv arriving a few feet away from me I go out into the street making it obvious I\u2019m there and he just does a u turn and goes back to where he came from and cancels my ride. Are you friken kidding me I\u2019ve already lost 16 minutes and they charge me a $5 cancellation fee when I didn\u2019t cancel anything ! I disputed and they returned the $5 but how does this help me ? You\u2019re just returning 5 that were already mine and now I\u2019m late to work I should be getting a discount or 5 dollar for you cancelling my ride this app is THE WORSE APP!"

Lyft definitely has the more competitive option. Plus it is a lot easier to get in touch with a customer representative when I have issues. I always have to argue through emails with Uber because it seems like none of their reps know what they are looking at or understanding half the time. It\u2019s such a pain to deal with. Why make it more difficult for users? It\u2019s even worse when the app glitches. From did the driver even start the ride to I had to cancel the trip just for it to end the actual trip. Then the times where the app wasn\u2019t working at all. Period. Oh, don\u2019t let me forget about the drivers I\u2019ve gotten as well. Made me question as to whether Uber will take just anyone as a driver. I\u2019ve been harassed and money stolen off of trips and have reported it NUMEROUS TIMES,  but that seems to not get me anywhere. 2 stars. Financially crippling for those who have to take uber, but no longer can afford it for work. Awful customer service, especially when you need to get things done, response time is the worst. App glitches, OFTEN. No point on constantly updating when it doesn\u2019t even change. Drivers that shouldn\u2019t even be exposed to people."

    "review": "Every time I have used uber, I\u2019ve learned that the \u201cestimated\u201d pickup and arrival times have been falsified for appeal. For example, my uber was supposed to come in 9 minutes, it arrived in 22 minutes. Therefore, we were late arriving to our destination over 30 minutes. There wasn\u2019t much traffic at fault. Our driver was choosing and switching music on his iPad while he was driving. This ride cost over $23 for myself only. There were 6 other people in the car. The driver had the audacity to ask for a 5 star rating. Once I told him he did not earn a 5 star rating, he low-balled me! Now my overall uber rating is a 4.8! However, 4.8 and still can\u2019t get customer service. I did email with Karen and Sara, so you know who to avoid in customer service.\n\nContacted uber support, as always, they did not do anything to solve the issue or follow their own standards and give me a refund. If the arrival time is over 5 minutes of the estimated time, their policy is to issue you a refund. They never do. \n\nI have heard rumors that people receive their refunds quickly, or get great customer service, but those rumors are false. Through research, no one I\u2019ve even met had received even mediocre customer service. The great reviews online and in the store are actually paid or otherwise enhanced with perks and such."

    "review": "I want to say that I have only had one major issue with Uber as a rider and I personally like Uber. However, I still think you need to improve the service. First, the location feature for the rider is subpar to me. I use Uber a lot to drive my to college and I have to put in a specific address just to have my drive take me to the part of the school I need the drive drop me off. It would be a lot easier to have a satellite view of the map give the drive an exact location of my destination. Second ,you are now starting to charge all these ludicrous fees such as the waiting fee if my driver has to wait more than two minutes at my pickup location. I understand that having to make the driver wait on me when I sometimes have to get ready when I should have done that before the driver arrived at my location is rude, but Lyft doesn't charge me a waiting fee. Third, I do not like the rating system. The idea that giving anything less than five starts automatically assumes that the driver did something wrong. If I give a driver a four star rating you assume that the driver must have done something. When I give a driver a four star rating I am telling the driver that I enjoyed the drive. I do not imply that I had a horrible experience with an Uber rider."

A week ago my Uber picked up the wrong person, let them change the location of their drop off, and then charged me for the extended trip. Having used Uber many times before, I assumed it was a fluke and contacted Uber and received a full refund. However, this happened again today! This time I knew better and canceled my ride, right when I got the notification that I was on my way when I was still waiting on the curb. I got charged a cancellation fee, because I canceled mid trip. I tried calling the driver multiple times to no success, and was forced to contact Uber AGAIN. \n\nWhile Uber\u2019s costumer service has been satisfying in the way that I have gotten my money back, the amount of time I have wasted these past few weeks has been irritating to say the least. I have spent at least an hour waiting for Ubers that weren\u2019t coming, and trying time and time again to call another Uber. I have been late to several events because of this, and have been forced to use Uber x instead of Uber pool because my pools have canceled on me or taken the wrong person. Uber has been a waste of money and a waste of time, and it doesn\u2019t help that they don\u2019t have a costumer service line so I can talk to a real person."

Today I had the worst experience w/ uber & i've been riding w/ the company since it started! I had a driver leave me as well as hang up on me due to miscommunication. I was on a uber pool ride, I understand that there are pick up locations. I was walking towards my pick up location while on the phone w/ the uber driver (Jesus), he hung up on me & cancelled my ride. I requested an uber for the second time & he was the driver again. I called an abundance of times which I have the records of my call history to prove that,  he stopped answering for me. I called again & he answered stating that he was parked 2 blocks over at the \"pickup location\". I asked if we could stay on the phone so that I can meet him; w/ frustration in his voice he agreed. I walked in the area he stated that he was in, he was not there. I told him a landmark of mine & he drove over immediately! In less than 1 minute! The moral is, I was charged a cancellation fee along w/ cancelling & I never cancelled my ride. I would like my money back as well as would like to report this driver. I was traveling w/ minimal funds, it'll be nice for uber to have an \"oops we charged you\" here's a free corteous ride due to UBER mistake! I had no $ to get another uber & used my last on a ride I never took!"

What if I want to tell him to take another exit, or look for Alaska Airlines terminal and he leaves me off at United, pointing to his phone GPS which tells him I want to go to United? Really? Anyway, there was no way to have a conversation with him.\n\nThat leads to a more serious point. NO ONE, no matter how good their driving skills, should be driving passengers without enough English to communicate if the trip is longer than 15 minutes! LAX was 50 minutes away. It required highway and exits. What if there was traffic jam, an emergency or I wanted to reroute for any reason? I certainly would NOT have allowed my daughter or son to ride with someone who could not communicate.\n\nI understand giving people a chance to make a living. I also acknowledge that the driver I had was an excellent one. But, he could not speak to or understand me. Asking drivers for a minimum of English speaking skills is not unreasonable. Furthermore, it is a safety issue for both driver and passenger. Uber, rethink this.",

    "review": "We arrived in Fort Lauderdale on a evening flight and after picking up our bags submitted our request for UBER.  I put in the address of 555 NW 62 St Fort Lauderdale as that was the of the Hotel we had reservations (Sheraton Suites Fort Lauderdale) I got a message saying I needed to move to the ride sharing area at the airport.  Saturday night at this airport was extremely hectic with dozens and dozens trying to use UBER. During this time my back back with laptop and many other valuables was stolen.  A witness reported he seen the guy take it and re-enter the airport.  I went in and reported my loss to airport security.  Returning I got a message that my ride had expired and would have to resubmit request.  I did and another Uber driver was on his was.   I asked him if he had the address 555 NW 62nd St and he said he did.  I then said that it was a Sheraton Hotel and was not far away.  He said ok.  After a few minutes we asked again although his English was pretty much non existent he said yes 555.  Shortly we found out we were on our way to Miami.  He then let us out at Wendy\u2019s way south of Fort Lauderdale and said I would have to \u201crequest a new driver sorry\u201d. So then we got another Uber that delivered us to the right address.  If the driver spoke English the situation would have been resolved earlier.  Our first experience with Uber was not a good one costing us over $60 to go just a few miles.",

    "review": "Uber was working great for me but as of the last week or so, it has been terrible. I keep trying to request a ride and then a driver is found for me but the driver never comes. I had to cancel like 3 rides, two I was charged for. I literally can\u2019t request a ride with Uber anymore. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on with this app but something needs to be fixed. I use to love Uber, I use them very often for work and personal. I got a credit for my fees I was charged for a cancelled ride and was issued a credit. BUT I STILL CANNOT USE THE APP AND REQUEST A RIDE TO EVEN USE THE CREDIT. He navigation is always off. Drivers asking me where to go, or the navigation just goes way out of the way making a 15 minute trip into a 30 min. It\u2019s ridiculous. I really want to continue using Uber but I can\u2019t keep getting cancellation charges for something that is Uber\u2019s fault. I requested an Uber and it showed that the driver was on the way. It said he was literally a minute away. I called the driver 3 times and I got no response so I cancelled the ride. And I got charged. Same thing happened twice. I\u2019m very disappointed. I hope Uber can make it worth the customers while to persuade them to stay. Because the competitors are looking good right now. They are a tab bit more expensive but at least the competitor is reliable. That is more than I can say for Uber as of late.",

    "review": "Gonna be honest, I\u2019m lazy as heck. If taking an Uber lets me stay in bed til the last possible moment, I take one. That being said, I\u2019m on first name basis with nearly all the drivers in my area. However, there are some bad apples out there. My main dislike is when drivers don\u2019t end the trip. I work at an airport, and I\u2019ve had drivers take me home and go all the way back without ending the ride until they get there. This results in a ~$25 trip costing $50+. Of course, this makes me have to go open a help ticket with support. (They made this harder to do it seems). Another trick of some drivers is to get close enough to start the ride, then if they don\u2019t like it, they\u2019ll either cancel it, or drive away somewhere far enough where I\u2019ll have to cancel it. On my dollar. What\u2019s more, if the support team see you have a \u2018pattern\u2019 of requesting a refund, they can deny you one. Even if it\u2019s clear it\u2019s an error on part of the driver. \nI feel like the driver\u2019s app should have a fail safe built in. If they make it to the drop off location, and leave farther than a certain distance, the trip should automatically end. God forbid I\u2019m busy when I make it home or to work and can\u2019t check if the driver still has the trip up. Sheesh",

Whereas I have been using this location for the last 2 years, why wasn\u2019t there any communication to drivers about this regulation? \n\nI talked to other drivers and one of the drivers used the same location I went recently in fact this year 2019  April but was not asked to go somewhere else, it\u2019s only NOvember a difference of 6 months and now they can\u2019t take inspections from there, that\u2019s okay I guess but surely such information should be communicated to drivers.",

Waiting for the next email requesting additional info...all the while my acct is possibly hacked and could be used by someone if that is the case. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT at this point!  Going on Day2. They managed to finally reset my account and allow me to login in to the website but the app still does not work.

    "review": "I use this service at least once a day. Over the last couple days though I\u2019ve had horrible drivers that I\u2019ve had to contact Uber about. I give them credit though bc when I write them they get back immediately and they at least try to rectify the issue. With a small credit or something. What I dislike is that a driver will accept ur ride but then take 5-10 mins to leave their house. Other times they are on the road and arrive in a timely manner. I had one driver refuse to let me stop at a fast food restaurant. I had another that missed the turn and ended up costing me an extra $7 for a trip I take frequently. And actually the day that happened I sent my friend a text sharing my location because we were lost, he ended the trip, and I had no clue where we were. I feared the worse. Anyway that\u2019s my rant. I still \u2764\ufe0f Uber and will continue to use them. The great thing is that if you rate a driver poorly, Uber won\u2019t match u with them again. The bad part is, u have to add all stops BEFORE ur trip. It\u2019s not like Lyft where u can add a stop while ur already in the car.",

    "review": "Highly useful application. Very versatile and makes it surprisingly easy to find a ride. The different types of Uber rides are easy to select and they can be found quickly using the touch screen interface. The map is highly accurate and displays in real time where the driver is located so you can monitor your progress both too and from your destination. The trip is also tracked via time giving you an accurate estimate of the time between destinations. The driver can contact you and leave a message when they arrive so you do not have to keep them waiting. Finally, once the ride is complete you can rate them and leave a tip easily. The Uber drivers are always friendly and helpful when you get into the car. It helps to be prepared and alert for the trip just in case there are multiple routes to your destination of traffic delays. Truthfully, the app is a very convenient way of getting around and I use it frequently. I would recommend this application to anyone who needs a fast and accurately trackable way of getting from destination to destination.",

And like each time I REFUSE to \u201c cancel\u201d the ride as the driver will collect 5 bucks of mine if I do. So instead I leave the app open in the background FOR HOURS until they cancel it on their end!!! I then have had to, 4 times now!, find an alternative way to get where I am going! These drivers are doing this on purpose to sit at home & collect these fees for accepting rides the NEVER INTEND TO PICK UP! They are hoping on you canceling!! BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO REPORT THIS TO UBER!!! There is no way to leave feedback for the driver regarding this issue. Uber cares not about its customer base, and their system for accepting user feedback shows this. I am very disappointed. I understand this is a driver related issue, but I rate this app poorly because I\u2019ve searched through all Uber\u2019s \u201c report\u201d options & can find no way to report this type of behavior nor a way to get back the time I\u2019ve wasted because I\u2019m charged for the defrauding act of bad drivers & left w/ no course of action to remedy this problem.",

Uber would not allow my sign on via cell, as it presented error message after error message stated that an error had occurred with the cell number. 4 hours trying to get Uber to work, tried deleting my account, Uber states that the account has been deleted, but it is still there via laptop sign on . Now,,,,,, try to find customer service or a chat help,,, good luck !!! The worst app service since owning a cellphone.

We were the lady to be admitted as they were closing the entrance.  We are definitely NOT happy with our very first experience with Uber and it will be my last.  $18 plus for purposely driving to the wrong location to increase the price is unacceptable!!!! Thankfully the Secret Service staff was kind enough to let us through.

(With note to use cash for any additional tip!). Too late- driver was gone!!  Why this change since I last used app 2 days ago?? I wanted to give a larger tip, so left $ 10 and logged out. Then logged back in to Recent Trips and was able to add more.   What is reasoning behind limiting tip to $10, which for my trip was less than 15%??   I don\u2019t carry much cash and like to give good tip to deserving drivers, so really do not like this change in the App. Seems many riders will not take time to try to tip more than $1 or $3 or $5    Why did Uber make this change?",

He (the driver) doesn\u2019t respond to the other riders text messages or the one phone call she made. So she (the Co-rider) cancels her ride. So all the time and the distance he drove looking for that woman was added to my charge which ended up being a bit over $16. I go to help section and press \u201cdriver got lost or took wrong turn\u201d and was told my fare wouldn\u2019t be adjusted because I was charged the price I was shown upfront. I then press \u201cdriver took poor route\u201d and was told the same thing. I sent support multiple messages to support about the situation with no response. I even sent screenshots of his total driving distance (9.91 miles) and the true distance of my pick up and drop off which was 7.3 miles. My receipt from that ride shows a base charge, distance charge, and a time charge. Every ride I took that day that went from point to point with no problem don\u2019t have those charges. But because he drove so off course I was charged for the extra time and distance he drove. WHICH makes no sense since a Uber pool or express has a set route the driver can\u2019t deviate from.

Upsetting as that may sound, it doesn\u2019t get any better for we\u2019ve looked for either and email or telephone number to Uber so we can get reimbursed for the two burgers and cola. To no avail.

He refused to bring the phone back to the bus station. He made us take another Uber to him 30 minutes away to get the phone. Mind you, he was simply sitting in a parking lot doing nothing. We then had to catch ANOTHER Uber back to the bus station. When that driver picked us up, he said that that spot was the area drivers sit in to wait for calls from the airport. Seriously? Second time, I'm waiting a good 15 minutes for my driver who appears to be lost and doesn't have sense enough to call me. Then I see the driver pass by me. I call him and tell him he's passed me. He mumbles something and hangs up. Then I see that I've been assigned a different driver. So, he cancelled me. Then he passes me again and just leaves. Are you kidding. There's no way he didn't see me. Third time, a driver tries to drop me off in a random spot that was not the address I gave. I then had to navigate him to the address with my own phone. I complained about the extra time charge and I am waiting to be refunded. Get better navigation and better drivers. In the meantime, I'll be using Lyft. Smh.",

    "review": "I would use uber to go home from work. I get off around 3 and it takes me about 20 minutes to get home from my job. This uber ride took 45 minutes because the Uber driver not only attempted to drop me off 30 minutes away from my house, but he was completely inappropriate. He was extremely upset for no reason. He did not want to take ubers maps, he wanted to take his own way which resulted in us getting us lost. That\u2019s when he attempted to just drop me off where we got lost. So I started talking to my boyfriend and my brother and they told me to tell him he\u2019s making me uncomfortable to please just take me home. So after going back and fourth about me not living in said lost destination, and him seeing me on my phone telling my fam what\u2019s going on he finally took me home. Which was so scary. I reached out to uber and they did nothing. They said they\u2019d reach back out to follow up with me because the driver was disrespectful. They never did. This driver was awkwardly quiet, only times he spoke his tone would stay angry and demanding. He kept sucking his teeth at me. He was extremely inappropriate & he blamed my destination for why he was frustrated. Nobody forced him to take my ride. I was so uncomfortable I had him stop a block from my house so I could walk the rest.",

    "review": "First off just in case this is TLDR, use Lyft instead, I\u2019ve heard good reviews of that service compared to Uber.\nI used Uber while on vacation over a few days. The drivers themselves were courteous and professional, the problem was with the ride selection system and their near non-existent customer service.\nOn multiple occasions, the system selected drivers for me who already had passengers. I watched on the GPS as the driver drove 15 minutes in the other direction, leaving waiting on the corner for over 30 minutes. Of course if you cancel and attempt to get another driver, you are hit with a $5 fee for \u201cwasting the driver\u2019s time\u201d.\nOn another occasion, the driver showed up but told me he couldn\u2019t make the trip and that I had to cancel, costing me $5. After I contested the fee on the app, they \u201crefunded\u201d the fee, but only in the form of credit on the app. I had no intention on ever using Uber again at that point, so I attempted calling a customer hotline to get a real refund. It doesn\u2019t exist. There is only an automated phone line that directs you to use the app for assistance, and the app only offers an FAQ and very specific automated help. Apparently there is a actual hotline, but it is only for customers who pay extra for Uber Premium. Forget that, I\u2019ll just take the $5 loss and switch to their competition from here on out.",

Once I made the selection, Uber gave me a projected arrival time, the driver\u2019s name, vehicle type,  and a tracking map to show the driver\u2019s progress toward my pickup location. My transport was on-time and very clean. The driver, Marco, was very pleasant and drove very safely to the drop-off point. The driver cordially answered questions about Uber and his driving history. We arrived exactly when projected and the driver made sure that I was delivered to the drop-off location that minimized my walking. The automated billing worked within a few seconds to verify that I was billed what I was originally projected. I received a text to a link within a few minutes to rate my experience. The entire process was efficient, informative, safe, and pleasant. \nI will definitely use the Uber service for future transportation needs.",

Then, despite all of that, it would not let me make a new trip because- get this- it hadn\u2019t actually cancel the ride, and, once I cancelled it myself, because I was making too many requests at once just trying to figure out the status of what was going on. I finally managed to schedule another one, but it would not show up in upcoming, so I had no idea if it was coming or not and was already searching for a backup plan when I got the notification that it was on its way. Again, I scheduled a ride over an hour beforehand to avoid stress, and because Uber waited to tell me about my payment method at the last minute, and because it kept glitching about deciding whether or not my ride was scheduled, I have ended up so much more stressed than needed.

    "review": "I typically only use Uber when I travel, and my first experience with Uber in Washington DC last year was fantastic.  I often opted for the cheaper Uber pool option. During a recent visit to NYC I realized the Uber pool option now requires users to walk a short distance. In theory, I have no issue with walking to get the cheaper rate, and I can see how it would be more efficient in cases where streets are one way and whatnot.  However, the GPS doesn\u2019t orient you and the pickup location is confusing. I would walk to a location only to see the driver would be at another location, calling me and asking where I am. The map doesn\u2019t orient itself according to the direction you are facing, adding more confusion.  This means I spent more time stressfully communicating with my driver before I\u2019m even in the vehicle just to find them, and if that doesn\u2019t work, you\u2019re out of luck and have to pay a $5 fine. Fix the GPS for walking. It should orient to the direction I\u2019m going, at least. Otherwise, offer a door to door pickup with Uber pool like it used to be. I\u2019m not going to pay $15 for an X when I can get the same trip for $5, but I also don\u2019t think myself as the customer or my driver should have to deal with a poor gps walking system implemented by Uber.",

I asked to speak with a manager at Uber multiple times, but the customer service reps refused and said they can\u2019t help with this issue. \n\nI scheduled a trip to the airport and the Uber driver canceled it 10 minutes before the pickup time. I requested another Uber trip and it took a half hour to come to my place. The trip was in the early morning, I wanted to get to the airport before the rush hour. Cancellation of the first Uber trip meant a half hour delay plus the traffic of the rush hour. So instead of arriving 2 hours and half before the take off, I arrived at the airport one  hour and 10 minutes before the take off which was late. So, my flight got delayed for one day and I had to pay for a fight change and one night hotel room. \n\nIrresponsible treatment from Uber and Uber drivers. Why Uber doesn\u2019t investigate such issues and at least give warnings to the irresponsible drivers. The driver knew that the time was critical because of the time and the road constructions.  Why did he accept the request if he was going to cancel it 20 minutes after accepting the scheduled trip? Who is going to pay for my time and money that I lost? I will never use Uber again.",

Please bare in mind I tried my Wells Fargo Debit, Credit, Easy Pay also PayPal & still it says the same thing. If I were to go on Lyft all of those cards including PayPal would works. This also happens on UberEats to. So I deleted the app because I cannot use my money on here. Than I gave it some time by waiting until more updates come in to see if they have fix this issue, however I tried it three times for once a month each to see if the updates would fix this. Still the same results, so I officially gave up on Uber/UberEats. My money going to Lyft & Post-mates.",

This is not only unacceptable but it is also frustrating because the app\u2019s SEARCH field does NOT allow the customer to specify the actual pickup address and it reverts to the app\u2019s default(s). Someone is making money by channeling traffic elsewhere (for additional fees and with added DELAYS); a blue \u201cbox\u201d locks you out but interestingly calling Uber for an inbound drop off to your selected location away from the main terminal is allowed. The current \u201crigged\u201d setup is also bad in case of an emergency because we can NO longer rely on the app to direct the driver where we actually are. Just for the record, there is nothing wrong with the GPS signal on our phone or iPad AND rebooting the app is completely useless, just like most of the developer\u2019s \u201ccanned\u201d responses. Looking back to find if our posted review(s) have been answered is futile and meaningless because there is NO useful way to search for keywords except for scrolling. Developer answers reviews selectively - SHAME!

He couldn\u2019t find any due to his language barrier.  His last resort was to use his car for Uber in order to bit by bit pay off what he owes. \n\nThings were going good for a while until just a few days ago where he was falsely accused of sexual harassment by a rider. Uber took no attempts in investigating the situation and immediately locked his account. Mind you he had a 4.7 or above rating for his rides, but instead of Uber looking into it or contacting any previous clients, they immediately cut him off. The woman was a larger size, and she forced my dad to wait outside for almost 30 or so minutes, which cost her extra. In a lazy and underhanded attempt to get her money back, she took advantage of the fact that my dad didn\u2019t have a camera in his car and accused my dad of sexual harassment and force Uber to refund her money. This in turn locked him out of his Uber account ended his only source of income that he could find, and further pushed him down a rabbit hole of debt that\u2019s almost impossible to climb out of. I\u2019m very angry at Uber for displaying this little care in a situation and offering my dad no due process. Shame on you, Uber.",

I could get to work within 12-14 minutes, between $10-$12...ironically, those are still the times and prices with Lyft. Uber however, insists or overly long gps routes and outrageously priced trips. From Mt. Oliver to downtown, it cost me $17 on a Sunday morning. Nothing was happening in town other then Lion King at 2pm and 6pm...I was going to work at 9:30. I failed to mention, the route Uber\u2019s gps selected, took us all the way to the West End Bridge. When I questioned the driver on the insane route, he insisted that Uber requires drivers to take the plotted route. They base their rates on mileage and time in the vehicle right? Then why purposely make a 14 minute trip at peek traffic times, take 20 minutes when there\u2019s nothing happening...to overly charge their customers is the only thing I can think of. I get it, it\u2019s a business and business is meant to make money but that is wrong on every level. Their competitor, Lyft, charged me $12 on a Monday morning, going to work at 8:30am, during rush hour, and we the route took us over the Liberty Bridge which makes 100 times more sense. 1 star for the inconvenience of an app that boosts affordable everyday fares",

(Regarding Ubers update, I should have predicted it, it\u2019s illegitimate. They will simply direct you to their customer service reps, who never take your side) Another note regarding Ubers update, it fits their MO, publicly ask that I reach out to them, so that I am directed back to the support reps who denied me. In response to Ubers response, I ordered a pizza from a restaurant that was only three miles away from my house, it was delivered cold. After two weeks, during which I was ignored for days at a time, I was told I would get nothing, not even a five dollar credit. Understand that I\u2019ve already wasted wasted hours on this issue and deleted both apps (even though I had gold status) I know that any re-review would not change anything.

In other words I would end up waiting until the driver got all the way to the gate to get a call saying that they can not get to me. I used Uber again today and the same situation occurred. It is a shame that with all the updates Uber has went through that the developers still have not found a way to fix this. The developers of Uber seriously need to fix the app to where it alerts the drivers that the customer is on a military installation, and that if the driver does not have installation access to not take the ride. It is very frustrating for military to have to wait until the driver gets to the gate to find out that the driver can not get on the installation to pick the customer up. It would also behove them to make sure that a good majority of their drivers coordinate with the military installations in the area they are driving in to try to get access to them as this will gain Uber more business.",

Uber used to be such a great app but I\u2019ve seen much more shady behavior over the past year. Completely disappointed. You guys lost me as a customer tonight and will continue to lose more after people catch on. Good luck!",

First, on several occasions I have not been able to see my \u2018earnings\u2019 or \u2018weekly summary\u2019. Instead, when attempting to view \u2018earnings\u2019 or \u2018weekly summary\u2019 the expected information does not show-there is just a blank screen. This is frustrating because it has happened more than once for longer than 10+ minutes. Unfortunately, this has happened while connected to WiFi and LTE. Secondly, this app drains the phone battery quickly. A suggestion would be to allow maps/navigation to route even while the phone is \u201clocked.\u201d Doing so would be more convenient and in the process not drain battery. Thirdly, when a customer sends a message, the message stays on the screen and keeps on popping up hindering the view for the navigation. Only clicking on the message, and then exiting out will clear the message from the screen. A suggestion would be to allow messages to display as a quick notification, just like a phone text message. In turn, this will help to not be so distracting.",

    "review": "While Uber\u2019s prices have skyrocketed recently, now comparable to a Taxi ride, Uber\u2019s app still sets them apart from the outdated Taxi business model. The issue with prices has to do with the way in which drivers manipulate the system. They figured out how to turn off their app, find areas where other drivers have done the same thing, and then turn it on knowing the price will be higher due to \u201cfewer\u201d drivers in the area. In Seattle this is a huge problem. Something Uber has failed to address. In fact, recently I found myself actually using Lyft because they tend to have much lower prices yet also have a similar awesome app that makes finding a driver so easy. \n\nNo matter the case, Uber\u2019s customer service is excellent and they remain a contender against Lyft. But unless they figure out a way to lower prices, it\u2019s hard for me to say which service I\u2019ll use more often. After all, $10 for a 1.7 mile ride is very steep - the same (or more) than using a Taxi. And then hearing a driver brag about making $1500 a week because he\u2019s figured out how to manipulate the system just makes me think I\u2019m the one getting ripped off.",

I picked the plan I needed and requested a driver. To my Suprise they had a driver pick me up within 3 minutes. Couldn\u2019t believe how prompt and professional she was. And FAST!. And she had a brand new beautiful car and was very accommodating. So sorry I forgot her name, but I hope Uber corporation looks at my review and can look up my last and only drive from Uber (but it won\u2019t ever be my last!), so they can give her an employee award or something. And when I needed a ride home she was there within minutes again. And again the price to take a Uber instead of a taxi is huge. Thank you Uber for offering your service in our small town.

Our driver messaged me through the app that he couldn\u2019t find us.  I wrote back exactly where we were, which was right outside of a very busy restaurant/bar.  I could see from the app that he was several blocks away, and it seemed that he wanted us to walk to him so he didn\u2019t have to drive through traffic.  I was visiting a new city, so fairly unsure where he was, and that is not how this is supposed to work.  The driver canceled the ride, but somehow I got charged for the driver\u2019s inconvenience; despite the fact that I was the one left waiting outside while numerous other ride-sharing cars pulled up to take passengers.  I tried to get another ride, but the fees had gone way up and the wait time was long.  I downloaded Lyft and had a cheaper ride within minutes.  I will say that Uber did credit may account after I complained, although it was a credit on my next ride and not an actual refund.  I have since moved on to Lyft without incident, so that credit would is basically useless and last Uber a customer.",

There was a bit of traffic so he asked if we wanted him to take an alternate route, when we asked if it would be faster he said yes. Of course we are going to say yes to beat traffic and if it would be faster. As he began driving a little I decided to enter the airports address on my own google map the ETA now said 10:25am, as he was driving it went up..he went the long route. When we told him he went the long way he decided to stop in the middle of the road and said no he didn\u2019t and asked if we wanted him to hop back on the highway..we said no just to keep driving since he was stopping in the middle of the road. He almost got into a few accidents along the way. We ended up arriving at the airport at 1035am and missing our flight and being stuck at the airport for 8 hours. When checking the Uber receipt it was about 85 euros, 25 more euros then the ride was suppose to be. I believe Tariq went the long route on purpose so I would be charged for distance and the total ride was an hour and one minute instead of 30. I was highly disappointed since I use Uber as a source of transportation a lot and mainly when traveling. Tariq made the Uber ride this morning terrible.",

Drivers are sharing that the app crashes or doesn\u2019t give them accurate information for pick ups quickly. Trying to take a different route means uber will punish the drivers. And if you try to submit a problem on the app it automatically pins it on the driver. I give 5 star ratings to drivers but the app and the company need to work harder at their quality. I stopped using uber in the past for ethical reasons and might do so again. Lyft is truly a better, fairer service\n\nEdit: today I waited 20 minutes in 100 degree heat because the Express Pool option kept switching my rides and putting me with drivers going the wrong way. Once again the gps makes trips too complicated, and I refuse to use the Help page forms which forces me to blame the driver. The form response Uber sends to these reviews does nothing and doesn\u2019t allow you to contact Uber.

    "review": "Let\u2019s get this clear, Uber is convenient! And after using it for 4 years I do find myself tapping on Uber more than other competitors but their customer service is REALLY kinda bad. If you ever need to write to them you would feel like you are corresponding with a bunch of robots as they are trained to cut and past standard answers from their library and often give you really stupid replies that do not make sense. \n\nOut of my 4 years experience using this app, I had to file complaints on 2 drivers. One being a super dirty slob that the car actually smells and filled with junk and rude and another one on his sexual harassment comments and questions during the ride. Both times Uber gave answers that are not satisfying. And the best laughable part is Uber\u2019s initial response to the latter driver was to give me $7 credit and thank me for being a loyal customer for over 700 trips! I was like \u201cwhat???!!!\u201d You gave me $7 to respond to my complaint on your inappropriate driver and not even bother to ask for details?? After writing few more complaints, a representative sounding extremely happy and joyful called me at 9:30pm to follow up on my very upsetting experience per my strong complaints...\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

The pricing is not that bad, as a rider you shouldn\u2019t tell the driver \u201cyour gps is messed up or taking us a longer way or what the case could be\u201d \n\nA rider should not seriously pay attention to the driver, if he/she is driving the wrong way or opposite way. there will be times, my drivers will take the total mistake as in he/she did not follow the directions or signs. he/she was a rider as us , they do not want to go into a taxicab as Uber is pricing just as regular yellow taxi . if Uber wants to make a rider not to completely take her/his time to tell a driver where to go . One of my Uber rides were from airport to home for my cousin, my driver who is supposedly from the city and grew up the same county as myself do not know any short way or avoiding the serious traffic. Please fix your gps very soon, or at least let the rider knew what way will be taken in the future , I agree with the previous writer . A rider should be allow to put someone who speaks their language instead a different language completely from other country . you want to make Uber more friendly and understanding to both driver/rider please hear us out !",

    "review": "I use this app often and used to be a fan of it overall. I even joined their rewards program because they promised flat rates and fixed rates for when surging happens. Ever since they recently priced their rides on a scale instead of a set price, I\u2019m getting charged much more and I can\u2019t even see why. I used to be charged 14-15 dollars to get to work every day without fail. Now, with the exact same route, it\u2019s 16-17. This is ridiculous and I\u2019m not even sure how it can be a law issue if Lyft hasn\u2019t done this at all. Also, what\u2019s the point of advertising a fixed rate for rewards members if you can\u2019t even provide it??\n\nUpdate: I understand that, I\u2019ve seen your copy paste reply to everyone who has an issue with the new update. It still doesn\u2019t explain why I\u2019m getting charged a couple dollars more when I joined a rewards program to avoid this very thing. What was the point of me doing that when all the \u201crewards\u201d have now been taken away? It also still doesn\u2019t protect me from drivers who\u2019d like to take advantage of this new system and take weird route just to jack up the prices.

For the most part it\u2019s convenient, useful, and wallet friendly. \nHowever, having recently encountered a technological issue I can\u2019t give this app the 5 stars I\u2019d like to. \nMy girlfriend ordered us an Uber and for some reason, the gps had us in a different location than we were. The Uber driver called us and we explained exactly where we were to him several times. He arrived late- which is okay. However we were later charged a late fee for something that was clearly outside of our ability to control. \nWhen I tried to challenge the charge through the app, it was immediately denied. I\u2019ve attempted finding a way of calling Uber to dispute this charge, but could not find any helpline. \nAny company that can\u2019t offer me a way to contact them directly about issues doesn\u2019t deserve 5 stars regardless of how good the app is. The customer service is horrible. My driver, I\u2019m assuming charged us for something we didn\u2019t do (we were waiting outside for him for about 7 minutes), and yet we\u2019re stuck with an extra charge and no way to explain our issue. This is unacceptable, and therefore I can\u2019t in good conscience recommend this app to others",

    "review": "A driver messed up my carpool ride and cancelled the trip when we first dropped off the other person who we carpooled with. He drove us through weird streets in the OPPOSITE direction (15 minutes away) from our drop off location. He sat there for 5 minutes looking at his phone, then tried kicking us (my friend and me) out of his car (the driver barely spoke English so it was hard to communicate.) We told him he should honor his mistake and drive us directly to our initial drop off location, but he refused and YELLED at us! My friend and I finally got out of the car because at this point we were in that spot in his car for 10 minutes. He was being rude and greedy yelling at us to order the ride again but we refused. He left us there STRANDED. When I had first requested pool, the amount said $5.99. When I got out of his car, Uber had charged me $9.29! I contacted customer service and told them about my issue and experience, and they refunded me $2!!! I had to message them again stating I wanted to be FULLY reimbursed before they did something about it. Untrustworthy drivers and poor customer service. Use LYFT instead. A lot more friendly drivers and customer service is excellent! Sometimes the price runs a little higher but you get what you pay for!",

But then from 12 min it changed to 15min and from 15min to 17min. The time changed again once more to 15min. It was at 15 min for a good 20min. I noticed that the drivers location on the map was not moving. I zoomed in and noticed that he was parked in the near by Walmart\u2019s parking lot. At this point I messaged the driver and asked if he was on his way, and mentioned to the driver that I see that he hasn\u2019t moved in quite some time now. The driver never replied back, but started to move on the map right after I sent it, indicating that he got my message. At this point I\u2019m waiting again, but realize that he has gone to another location away from mine. Not only did the driver waste my time, I also missed going to the cook off because it was too late. I had to cancel my Uber ride and my plans for that night.

What work? We haven\u2019t seen this driver neither took that ride obviously! So you should reimburse her from your own pocket!

Apparently the only way to receive decent customer support is to give the App itself a bad review.  There are other ride options, with similar or better pricing, and with actual customer support should there be an issue. \nOne more issue to note: the GPS that the drivers are made to use is HORRIBLE.

    "review": "Uber lately has added a way for riders to take rides without having enough money to cover their trips and while this may seem like a great idea for the passengers, what they don\u2019t tell you is that this option now locks drivers out of their earnings for over a week when they depend on the timely instant pay feature to eat and have gas in their vehicles to continue providing those professional rides and keep their vehicles clean. Their driver support is purely an informational service that sees the system that is malfunctioning as some sort of untouchable deity. They used to have a phone number for the passengers who had issues as well to receive support but that is gone away now and I\u2019m thinking their service will likely start to die away if they don\u2019t start treating drivers well. Also many customers are unaware of the ratings system used. If a driver falls below 4.6 rating they permanently deactivate that driver and refuse to reactivate them later or even allow for any sort of appeal to the unfair ratings. They take the passengers word over the drivers and won\u2019t even listen to both sides of the story before making a judgement regarding that decision. Uber you have officially just lost a 5 year driver and passenger as a result of this.",

I paid over $1400 in hospital fees myself, out of pocket, because Uber was unwilling to give the full name of the driver or any other identifying information (and of course, it was a new car, so no license plate), which prevented me from accessing the police report in the city and getting my insurance to cover the hospital bill. Uber reimbursed my $8 ride, but did absolutely nothing to help me get in touch with the police department or aid in the reimbursement process. There was no apology, nothing. They did not care. Another time (before the accident), when I was on my way to the airport, I was left on the side of the road at night in an unfamiliar area because my driver decided \u201chis shift was over.\u201d As a young college woman in a large metropolitan area, it was extremely concerning for this to have happened. When I brought the issue up to Uber, again they reimbursed my $14 ride, but refused to look into the driver\u2019s file at my request or attempt to better their screening process for drivers.

    "review": "A few days ago, I took an Uber to my house. A day later, I received a message from Uber stating that a wallet has been returned to me and thus a fee of $15 was charged. However, I never lost nor reported a lost wallet. I also never received a lost wallet. The uber driver falsely reported that I had lost my wallet and that it had been returned in order to receive $15. This charge caused me further financial issues. After reporting this issue to Uber through the \u201cHelp\u201d section on their app (which is the only way I was able to come in contact with an Uber representative), I was told that such a charge was not recognized in their system. After continuously trying to get in contact with customer support, I was finally told that the money would be refunded within 3 to 5 days.

I\u2019ll say I have been using Uber for the past 3 years. I\u2019ve had good drivers and bad drivers! Honestly these are people who use their personal cars to help others get to where they need to go! When I get into an Uber I really just want to get to my destination. The GPS sometimes take drivers to longer routes, but since I know where I\u2019m going it\u2019s not difficult to navigate your driver! If you know a faster route I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal to let them know. Secondly, everyone complains about rates! It\u2019s a service that you\u2019re getting cheaper than a regular car service, a $50 car service might be $15 with an Uber, I personally understand fare surges, and think based on the time of day it\u2019s fair to do this since they are sometimes not many drivers around. I use Uber and Lyft daily to go between work and home and the service has been awesome.",

When the app periodically gave \"slight delay,\" to those of us that use Uber almost daily....the company would send you a week of 50% off promo for a week. That was certainly an incentive. I've had a lot of \"slight delay\" trips and have recently received a 30% off promo. What is annoying with that, is that the app will quote a lower price and then conveniently shut down and when you open the app again, a higher price quote will appear. This past week, I've relied on good ol' yellow cabs to give me fairer prices. Especially with Uber pool...there should be a cap of pick ups! I've had to squeeze in very inconsiderate back seating because I have shared rides with more than four people. The drop off are also getting further and further away from your actual drop-off location as well.

I mean you would think even when you spend hundreds with a company monthly they would atleast value your business as a customer. But this is not the case with Uber. Instead they leave you with a customer service message box where when they feel like they want to help you they can and when they don\u2019t want to help you they simply reply where you can\u2019t even send a message back to let them know how dissatisfying it is that your money was taken and no product was received.

I received 4 emails for the fare to/from the concert as well as what I tipped. However I noticed on my bank statement that there was an additional charge.

I contacted Uber and sent them the info they requested only for them to say they do not see this charge on their records and to contact my bank. When I contacted the bank they just ended up canceling my card and will be sending me a new one. This is inconvenient since now I have to wait for a new card.

I have to reactivate my ride pass every month and never had any issues until yesterday when the app wouldn\u2019t allow ride passes to be purchased through the app for pilot program users. I contacted uber on facebook asking to be sent the link to activate my ride pass online as my friends who were noot able to complete the ride pass purchase on the app were able to do so online. I provided my email and phone number as requested but they never sent me the link and it was as if they didn\u2019t even read my message because they kept saying to purchase ride pass i needed to be eligible, even though i clearly explained i am blind and have been eligible, as well as have been using ride pass every month for over a year. It is not the first time they completely ignore simple requests online in my experience and often i am left with no customer support at all and having to resolve issues myself or by asking other users. As it has been said many times on here...the quality of customer service is non-existent and gets a 0 rating.",

    "review": "Been an Uber customer now for roughly 3 years with nothing lower than a 5 star rating. Their service is good and makes traveling convenient, especially when out of state.\n\nThat being said, they need to work on their customer service aspect of their business. I had a driver who tried to charge me $80 in cleaning fees for no reason. He simply submitted a picture of a wet blanket on top of his car seat to Uber and reported me for things I didn\u2019t even do. Trying to get a hold of their customer service department took over a day due to high volume on the chat feature on their app. They quickly sided with the driver and it took some time to finally get the charge removed. However, now my rating is affected by this fraudulent driver who keeps banging his customers for cleaning fees and other false charges/incidents.\n\nI would recommend adding a 1-800 number for starters and suggest that Uber has penalties for its drivers who try to jack up their fees for no reason and lies about incidents. Again I have been a loyal customer for 3 years, with a 5 star rating and got no incentives from them to keep using their services. Instead I get an $80 cleaning fee as a thank you.",

When I\u2019m waiting to get an uber, and the app shows 2+ cars literally sitting outside the building I am in, it is not fair or right to charge absurdly high surge rates. The fare to my house from work is in the $5.15-$5.95  range, but it surges to over $20 when it\u2019s \u201cbusy\u201d? Not cool. It\u2019s not busy if there are 2 or more cars sitting outside waiting, you can\u2019t charge surge prices like that, it\u2019s immoral and wrong and price gauging. \nAlso, you should not allow drivers to take a fare if they are still driving someone else home. Numerous times I get a driver, it tells me they are X amount of minutes away, but still finishing another trip, so the X minutes away keeps going up and up, meanwhile, another Uber shows up close to me that I could get but I can\u2019t because I have already been claimed by another driver that keeps getting farther away, and I\u2019ll be charged if I cancel with them. This is garbage, it should never happen.

I called her and it was awhile before she could figure out where she was.  I then gave her specific directions how to get to my street (two left turns from where she was).  After waiting another 5 min or so I called her and she had made two right turns instead as that is what \u201cUberGoogle\u201d told her to do. She had travelledAWAY from my house!  She then cancelledthe ride ($5 my expense).  I had to start over and with a plane to catch!  After wasting 15-20minutes the rate was now more than double what it was earlier and I had to wait an additional 10 minutes to be picked up.   All in all I ended up leaving for the airport a half hour later than planned and at twice the rate. I did make my flight and the third driver was good but I then was not given the $10 credit on my first ride, was charged an additional $5 for a driver not showing up and then cancelling, and had to pay almost $25 more than if my first request was honored.

So after 3 attempts, I went over to Lyft, tried a couple times and same thing, no rides. Not a big deal, got a taxi instead and went home. Come later that night I open my bank app only to find Uber took $322 out of it for my attempted rides, even though they were never done and it doesn\u2019t show them on my app!! I contacted them about this issue, only to be forwarded a email \u201cwe are sorry for this inconvenience, your money will be returned to your account in 3-5 days\u201d so because of Uber\u2019s mistake I have to now wait multiple days to get over $300 back that they took (put a hold on) they then proceeded to try blaming this on my bank, stating that this is a very common thing done between all drive share apps. Meanwhile Lyft never took any money from me for my attempted rides, and after speaking to them. If the ride does not pair with a driver, they do not take the money. So I am out $320 for about 4 days, Uber services was no help in getting it back faster, and they lied about this being something all companies do.. will not be using them ever again. Snakes",

Maybe you can find a way to give the passenger the option of paying $1 extra on pool to be picked up at their actual location. \n\nAlso, I have had to direct the drivers not to take a particular route the GPS sends them on because it takes them up a back road and then has them crossing busy traffic with no signal when all they have to do is turn left out of my driveway and there is a signal right there to the same highway. \n\nAnd, is there some way to fix a location drop-off. My work address always takes them to the NORTH gate which has been closed for the past 7 years and they need to come to the SOUTH gate on a different street. It\u2019s a big company with a lot of people that use UBER. The drivers have always been understanding, but pickups are more complicated than drop-offs.",

However the app is totally internet dependent, meaning that if your not connected to wi-fi the app won\u2019t work for you.  This is very short- sighted, I believe, because things happen there should be ways available to contact Uber, cancel rides or modify trips other than through the app itself.  Hence my title, sometimes I request pickups but things come up and I am not able to contact the drivers or cancel my trip( not every location has wi-fi).   Secondly, the app has added protective features such as call 911 and share my ride with family along with app changes like rider ratings but these are more so-so  features that really don\u2019t change anything; if I have no access to wi-fi I can\u2019t use the protective features and the whole idea of rider ratings could be insulting to some people, Trips aren\u2019t free.",

So Do not use Uber, the system for payment is horrible and they will cheat you out of your money. If you do take Uber take a picture of your ride inside before going in and after or else the Uber driver will charge you \u201cpersonal fees.\u201d",

For example, I\u2019ll order it, it\u2019ll say 3 minutes to arrival and then flash to 7 min and then it will take 10 min. You certainly have enough data about San Francisco to have better timing algorithms. This is a major point of frustration and I\u2019ve been late several times. Finally, I go from my home to my gym a few times a week on Uber. EVERY time you recommend the driver does a u-turn on a busy road as the way to drop me off. So you know what? They drop me off across the street - which is a bus stop & technically illegal - and I either have to run through traffic or walk to the end of the block and wait for the traffic light. Your gps should pick a route that isn\u2019t completely ridiculous and that the driver will actually do. These issues get me so frustrated I have now switched to using lyft more frequently.

Also they charge way too much if your driver takes a different route or misses turns. I was charged almost 3 dollars more than the price it was supposed to be because my driver took a whole different route that was unnecessary and took more than 10 minutes when it was supposed to take about 5 minutes and had to take a different street because of road construction.",

The Uber driver did not speak English and took us over the bridge into NJ, got LOST and missed many turns. We eventually had to pull up our own GPS and google translate, to help her and she almost ran a red light. She had no clue where she was and made me feel very unsafe in the car. This ride turned from an 8 minute ride to 30 minutes, making us late to an event. I was then charged triple the amount it was originally supposed to be. I contacted Uber support and at first they gave me a $5 reward after them charging me $27 (the nerve). I then further reached out saying I wanted a refund and they kept telling me they were unable to do so.... they eventually took off the $27 charge and charged me for what it originally was. I continued to reach out saying it was unfair I\u2019m paying for a ride that was absolutely awful but they were rude and refused to give me a refund.

Now when you look at the app and see ten cars just minutes away, don\u2019t believe the lie. Once you request the car, the app does not give you one of those many available cars, but instead someone who is much farther away and not finished with a current fare. Never used to be like this. No longer trust the App. Did they lose all the good designers?  Or is customer experience simply no longer a priority?  Definitely will start looking at Lyft to see if they can do better.  Don\u2019t know if they can, but Uber has lost any loyalty it built over the years.\n\nUpdate:  once again Uber shows disdain for customers, assigning trips to drivers who are far away and not done with a previous trip. Driver then cancels forcing rider to start over with another driver far away. Can\u2019t fathom why Uber isn\u2019t losing customers and market value hand over fist.

On rides home, when I watch the GPS they always miss the turn and they always blame the GPS. It\u2019s not until I walk a couple houses down just so they can see me because if I waited at my actual address they would just keep driving up and down right past me. It always conveniently happens when I have to go to work. I always give a stretch of time that I would need to wait for a ride and yet 6 minutes turns into 15 or 20. Lovely app. Ok anyone can be a driver so long as they have no bad driving history but maybe there should be more requirements to see whether or not they can also navigate with a GPS. These drivers are complete morons and if the poor navigation werent enough, the chatty ones don\u2019t seem to know when someone isn\u2019t interested in conversation.

I\u2019ve also filed a complaint with my state\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office. Lastly, I\u2019m letting everyone know that I can that Uber may very well just shut you down in your time of need, and with no reason whatever.

    "review": "I travel alot and do not have a car, so I use Uber on a daily basis. Or shall I say, I used to use Uber. All I did was change change my bank card number couple months back, so because a few dates went unpaid they deactivated my account. I have every intention of paying these fares, just need access to account to add new credit card number and done. Easy right? A 20 minute phone call could clear it up? Nope. Uber doesn't allow calls, it's all email based customer service system. So, we are on day 76, and email 51 to try to get whatever fares I owed paid. Seriously, I counted. Every single email I send is responded back by a different person, so I would say roughly 40% of the emails are a generic automated response of 'just open your account and add new card', followed by that person closing the claim, then me having to start all over again. Seriously, hands down the worst experience with customer service ever. Even if they ever figure out how I can pay them to get my account reopened, they went from me using without second thought, to being my last possible option in countries without other ride shares. I really hope anyone in charge reads this. FIX THIS SYSTEM.",

This is not fair Uber doesn\u2019t investigate the situation entirely if a rider makes up a complaint because they tell you they are missing they train or they will miss their flight and get made at you and tell you they have faster route then if you switch lanes to cooperate with the rider then the riders get mad they missed train or bus they report you and if it\u2019s traffic they report you and say you driving slow or switching lanes. After thousands of rides and a few bad reviews not to mentioned alll my rewards and good reviews they deactivated my account Uber gps also makes it where you might have to do sudden turns because it was slow but it\u2019s all the driver fault I guess because I have been deactivated",

You might say \u201cyou don\u2019t have to choose pool,\u201d but the concept is just a bad idea.\n\nSaving Home and Work pick up locations is a great idea, and being able to save destinations is helpful. But expand pick up location selections so we can name our own locations would be helpful. Setting up predetermined trips would be even more helpful. You should be able to choose \u201cPick up MOM and bring her to UNCLE JOE, etc. without having to manually plan the route each time.\n\nLastly, PAY YOUR DRIVERS MORE OF A PERCENTAGE. The quality of drivers and cars will increase exponentially if you take less and give them more (15% commission for Uber is more than fair). Anything more is exploitation, in my view. They are paying car payments, fuel, insurance, maintenance and more.",

But once they stopped accepting me, well I got another Uber that was still over 20 mins away and I had to settle because all the cancelling was just wasting my time.

I ended up waiting an hour because I had to wait for a new driver, who didn\u2019t have any problem finding me. The worst part about it is I messaged the first driver twice and tried to contact him so that he could find where I was but there was no response, just a cancellation. And yet the driver was rated highly, even though I would consider this highly unprofessional. I hope that in the future Uber looks into this and holds their drivers a little more accountable.

Also, connecting to the driver for pool shows a 2 minute wait. I know connecting to the driver takes time, but if you can always successfully connect at the end of your 2 minute count down, that means under the hood you are able be finder driver before that count down finish most of the time.

It showed drivers on the road and we were all set. At the end of our night we opened the app and TRIED to order an Uber...we immediately got a message telling us that because of traffic and the holidays that we could not schedule a ride from a certain time on the 31st to the 1st?! What?! We thought we were stuck!! We opened the Lyft app that we downloaded as a back up and within minutes (2 mins to be exact) we had a driver right around the corner coming to pick us up!! I was so relieved but very disappointed in Uber!! I believe that this message should have been displayed when the app was downloaded so that people KNEW they wouldn\u2019t or might not get a ride!! I will never use Uber...only Lyft! Our driver was so nice the app was smooth and let us know who was picking us up and the car description and plate# along with real-time map to let us know where he was! Uber let us down on the most important night of the year when MOST people need a Designated driver!!",

The driver called me about ten minutes later to ask me where I was, and I told him that I was in the designated pick up area. He said he was dropping off another rider at departures and he'd circle around again to come pick me up, and I said okay; then he asked me where I was going and I told him. He didn't seem happy about it, and while I was trying to describe what I looked like so he could find me easily, he hung up on me. \n\nSeveral minutes later, he pulled up, picked up another rider that was standing a few feet away from me, and drove off, and my app said it was locating another driver for me. This new one was supposedly 13 minutes away. \n\nI tried to call Uber to see what had happened, but the automated system wouldn't recognize my phone number, even though it's not blocked and it's the same number listed on my Uber account. I tried to cancel this latest ride but Uber wanted to charge me $5 for the new driver's time. Instead, I had to contact that driver and he canceled the ride for me. I ended up taking a taxi.

I got charge randomly one time for saying I went all the way to the airport when I never did and I was going to the train nearby me. I did report a complaint and got my money back but that should not have happened in the first place because I did rate my driver after he dropped me off to my destination. These are poor drivers and need to hire ones that will take this job seriously. Not some half-assed lazy people. The GPS also needs to get worked on. It is very late and sometimes gets stuck at a random area when the driver have already reached my meet up point. The GPS also needs to get updated as well. It sometimes has drivers taking extra routes when there are maps that take a simple route. It also tells driver to turn in area that you cannot turn into because it's a one way road.

I was a diamond member and I monthly pass user and Uber Pass User. Most recently my debit card was stolen which lead to me unlinking my card when the new card came it was hacked and being used as a Master Card instead of a Visa. I reached out to customer service and they basically told me to unlink all of my methods of payment and to try to re link  methods of payment that would work. Someone even asked me to send pictures of the debit and credit cards I was trying to use.  Uber blocked me from linking any payments and being able to use my app. It\u2019s been over a week and I\u2019ve had to rely on other ride app shares that aren\u2019t of quality or service. Uber customer service claims my case is pending.... while it\u2019s pending I\u2019m left with only lyft ride share app to use in my area which is typically more expensive and their drivers struggle to find their riders even with gps assistance.

I have had a few unfortunate situations where drivers have refused me bc of my dog, which SIGNIFICANTLY wastes time. I have to wait 1-2 minutes for the app to find me a driver, I (as the rider) have to send a message to someone driving a moving vehicle in traffic to let them know I have a dog, wait for them to respond (2 min), and then the drivers ask me to cancel (wasting more time). In the off chance the driver does not respond and they come to me only to let me know they are refusing me bc if my dog, another 5-10 minutes have been wasted. You need to update the app, allow a rider to proactively select if they are riding with an animal (service pet or otherwise) and then only pair them with drivers that have \u201copted in\u201d to transport pets because the waste of time is impacting my ability to get to work in a timely fashion.

Recently, I selected a $15 trip and was charged $26 because the driver (who was nice) took a different route. I had a conversation with the driver about it, but he was simply following the directions given to him from the app. In the end I was refunded the difference, but it took some arguing and I ultimately decided to leave Uber because of it. This was the second time that had happened in a year. The rep I had spoken with about it called me noncompliant when I wanted to ensure that my fare was being adjusted. Uber is a good app for its purposes whose reps normally respond fairly enough, but it is still growing and being developed and I definitely need a break & some time with another app.\nThe UberEats fares are also pretty outrageous compared with other food delivery apps.",

I was charged a rather large waiting fee ( with no warning or notification until the trip was finished) because the pickup place was changed, but there was no clear indication of where pick up was. In addition a large surcharge that was totally unexplained was added to my trip charges. There were absolutely no tolls involved in either trip!

Also the other most annoying and unreasonable thing that happens is when they connect you to a driver the app says there is one near or less than 4 mins away but somehow it always allows for a driver 10 minutes away to get my ride like why doesn\u2019t the app just not allow the drive to not get that ride since the main screen is telling us that there is another driver even closer it makes no sense to me",

It took me more then an hour, to which I got out of the car and walked 15 minutes to my destination. Later I discovered the original $8 charge changed to $26.... I tried to use the app to refund me but all they offered was to reduce my fee to $15... I was really upset as I should have had that ride free due to the walk. Uber needs to look into changing this feature and needs to take that $15 charge out. I am losing faith in this company."

I know I only needed to go 2 miles... but I needed a ride. I had to get on my knee scooter and go to Davis convention center on my knee scooter. I just had surgery 3 wks ago!!  I was counting on the great service I generally receive from Uber. Every hotel within 10 miles of Davis CC. Could have taken riders all day long. The ROSE DOLL EXPO is here for 4 days. It brings in 10,000 mostly women and young girls. There are also grandmas\n and disabled people who are trying to use your service. I\u2019m really upset I endured excruciating pain. I can\u2019t believe it!! 5.00. Wow!! Hey cancel every rider and take in the dough!!\ud83d\ude21I tried to use you again later in the day and they said my account was no good and to add funds in my account..  so I did.  Every time I tried to order it said my account was no good.  Augh!!!!  I\u2019m going to fight this with my bank!  Uber, u today would have been a fun day on vacation with my 8 yr old grand daughter. Instead,  I pain in the A- S.  Seems like if I , cancelled the ride then I understand a fee is appropriate.  But for Uber to cancel on ME!!  Very very upset with you Uber."

At the time of my request and after waiting more than 20 minutes to get connected with a driver. I was asked by the system to choose another ride because all drivers were busy I was bummed honestly and I\u2019m still waiting for my refund. I didn\u2019t want to waste anymore money and really needed to get home so I requested a ride with Lyft instead. I like Uber it\u2019s a cool app, however it seems like the majority of the time the drivers have gps issues when picking me up and of course it\u2019s fine when it comes to dropping me off. If some small changes could be added to the app to improve itself that would be great. I would like to see an actual customer support/service option for riders that actually allows you to speak to someone via phone/chat about any issues one maybe facing would be really helpful. Oh and one more positive about Uber is at least you may not have to wait too long. This morning I had to wait too long."

At the end I arrived at 4.45 and I order my Uber at 4.05... how do you explain that? It wasn't because of the trafic, nor the driver but because of you algorithm. You wrong people on the real time and then they have to wait and they are late for their appointment. \nYou recently launched the in real time localisation for the driver to see where he is. Except that the driver doesn't always check that so it doesn't work well and then I have to run to pick up my Uber... and now, in your customer service on the app, they deleted the section when you can complain about the drive so there is no way to have a compensation for the bad service.

The customer support person tells me I make to many complaints and that I'm not able to get a refund, bc of it. And I don't think that is fare. First of all when I use to order Uber eats most of my food was wrong, or cold. And I gotten a refund the last time I order with Uber eats it was from a restaurant in palatine and they burnt my five potatoeskins all I wanted was a refund for those or a complimentary something. But No they told me I already have way too many complaints. Now another time I used an Uber pool. My 13 year old daughter was getting picked up from her high school to home which was about a mile away. She got a pool. And the Uber driver went and picked him up. Now mind you my daughter was almost home. Tell me why the Uber driver kept going to the other passengers destination. Passed up Her destination. And they charged me  the amount he was suppose to pay. I never saw it till 30 days later in my bank account. Not on Uber's app. Uber is a big joke when satisfying customers needs."

If you don\u2019t cancel your ride within the first two minutes than it will automatically charge you a fee. Which is fair I suppose. The only thing I don\u2019t like about this app is that you can only cancel and not be charged if the driver cancel on their end. So even if they\u2019re 10-20 minutes late and the fault is on their end you could end up with the bill. I think that app needs to give an option so that if the driver is late the rider can cancel. I\u2019ve heard from my brother, who also uses the app often, that some shady Uber drivers will just wait at location and wait for the rider to cancel so they don\u2019t have to drive them anywhere and save on gas. \nI\u2019m a college student I don\u2019t like having to pay for another ride just because someone is running late and I can\u2019t wait 10-20 minutes for someone otherwise I\u2019ll miss my class.

Last night I went from my house to the mall for a discounted rate. When I wanted to leave the mall, I tried to request an Uber but no one would pick me up. We saw many drivers circling, looking for rides but the app blocked me from getting them because they didn\u2019t want to honor the discount that they offered me. We requested for over 10 minutes but could not get any driver to accept our ride. We used Lyft and they picked us right up. I asked the driver if he did both Lyft & Uber and he said he did. He told me my ride request never reached him thru the Uber app. This is really shady because we can\u2019t blame the drivers for not honoring our discount and Uber knows it!  They might offer you a deal but they will leave you high and dry when you count on them to get you somewhere. Use Lyft, they are an honest company, unlike Uber.\n\nResponse to Uber reply -\nI can access my account, I\u2019m not a moron thanks!

And then there\u2019s the problem of me putting in my address and drivers being led astray to the adjacent alley for both pickup and drop offs, leading to a lot of confusion and potential cancellations. Uber Pool sometimes passes my actual destination on the way to drop me off at this supposed \u201cmore convenient\u201d location. Essentially everything that is labeled convenient is not and the in-app directions waste time with inconvenient ones. Also I want a return of the Uber Pool option where the driver picks me up from my address, not walking to a random intersection. The other day, the driver and I spent 5 minutes each trying to cross an intersection to get to each other. And the next Uber Pool rider had to be picked up in an extremely congested area with big streets so our driver had to pull two U turns. Luckily he was very skilled in LA traffic. Additionally it\u2019s crazy that I can\u2019t provide this feedback through the Uber app without filing some kind of complaint for the driver / ride.

I had a driver show up at my grandparents house where he dropped me off the week before asking if I lived there and if he could see me. I reported the issue to Uber and, over a year later, have not heard anything. Along with the unprofessionalism of the drivers. Uber itself is extremely unprofessionally and nowhere near customer-based. Unless you physically google \u201cUber Customer Service\u201d you wouldn\u2019t be able to get ahold of anyone from the app itself. Thirdly, the GPS system is absolute garbage.

He went to ask what was my problem. My problem? I was just asking him about his policy. I agreed to not eat and yet he continued to be unprofessional. He showed aggression. I hope this driver never gets to ride ever again. I\u2019m not sure if he trying to be racist, cuz I\u2019m sure he gets this often. Plus i was only eating an apple.

After 15 minutes, I finally had to cancel the second Pool request on my own since it was clear Uber was not planning on matching me with a Pool driver. Now the logical assumption would be that there were no drivers. However, thanks to the app update I can now see where people around me are ordering rides. Seeing as how I saw countless people be matched with rides (some even just several hundred feet away from me), it\u2019s clear there were drivers in my vicinity but Uber didn\u2019t want to match me with them since there were no other riders heading in my direction. Just a stab in the dark here - Uber didn\u2019t want to lose the money on a Pool fare getting a ride to herself. Within 10 seconds of finally giving up and cancelling the pool request, I ordered a UberX with the higher fare. I was matched with a driver within seconds. Shocker."

She recently lost her phone and last remembers having her phone to identify the Uber she ordered.  Unfortunately the Uber driver never responded to any of her calls and messages, and Uber reported that the driver has not responded to their attempts either. What is most frustrating is how Uber Customer Support continues to ignore her direct question: Is the driver still going to be able to take on more passengers while ignoring a customer AND Uber representatives?  If the driver can continue to take on new passengers while ignoring everyone, it is quite possible that driver may not follow other protocol and procedures that are or should be in place for everyone\u2019s safety. If the driver was no longer able to take on new passengers, it might encourage him to respond one way or the other to someone. That Uber cannot be bothered to take any additional steps or answer a direct question is frustrating and telling..."

This are problems\n1. App - driver/gps, help options/ customer service, prices where there ain\u2019t really a price difference between 3 basic options \n2. Company- have no customer service number, run by a computer program (highly think it is), security- money, customer ain\u2019t their priority, WHO RUNS THIS COMPANY?\n3.

    "review": "Within a one months time, I\u2019ve experienced over 5 issues with uber support and their drivers. On 3 of those occasions I was not picked up by my driver at all; however, the drivers proceeded to confirm my pickup through the app and take my money without me even taking the trip. Whenever I tried to cancel the trip I was charged a cancellation fee. Whenever the driver cancelled, I was charged the full amount of the trip I did not take and one occasion I was charged even more than the original cost. Every time I have filled a complaint through the help section of Uber support, I received little to no compensation at all. Whether my trip was $10 or $30, my only compensation has been $5 in Uber cash. Which ultimately equates to absolutely nothing, considering the fact that $5 will get you nowhere, but perhaps around the corner in an uber. I have yet to be fully refunded. I have been using uber for 2 years now and I am shocked and disgusted by this new trend of just straight up, ripping customers off. I am tired of the incompetence of the drivers and the unprofessionalism of the Uber app and its help/support system. I would seriously consider trying Lyft before using this app."

I have had a few sketchy/questionable drivers myself. One driver couldn\u2019t drive straight on a freeway once which was a nightmare. I have a 4.7 rating myself so this is of no concern for me. But, when you have other problems within a business, banning customers is  majorly \u201crubbing a person off in the wrong way.\u201d It\u2019s basically saying that your business is too good to take any person. But, it\u2019s not. Drivers have lied trying to tell me I made a mess in their car when there never has been in order to charge more unnecessary fees. If you\u2019re banning bad people you better be banning bad drivers and do a better job with your system. We need to stop letting businesses punish all consumers for other\u2019s actions they personally can not or do not want to handle on the back end. It\u2019s very disrespectful to be reading such articles when you know Uber is far from the most perfect app themselves. This company and who decided this policy seemed to be a very self centered thought. One, that lacks any self awareness."

I\u2019m able to see the picture of my driver and the license plate of my driver. \n\nOne thing that can be improved is the standby time. For example, if I\u2019m calling for a pick up, there needs to be some compromise of time. The 2 minute wait by the driver at the pick up location may not always work. How about a 5 minute wait? Sometimes the driver is not in the area and takes some time to get to the location. If the driver doesn\u2019t see the passenger/customer and has tried to reach them by phone, there should be a small charge of $2.00. This will be a small fee from the customer for not being ready for the pick up. Then, the Uber driver can cancel the pick up and move on to the next pick up. But this would only apply if the passenger is also ready for pick up and confirms that they are ready. \n\nConversely, if the passenger is ready for a ride and the uber driver takes 15 min to get to the pick up location, Uber doesn\u2019t discount the ride because there was no driver available within 5 min. The passenger just waits. So, how about give the customer a 5% discount coupon on the next Uber ride for being on time for pick up, especially on rides where the passenger waits more than 15 min for a driver to arrive. \n\nThink about it! \n\nSincerely,\nHappy Customer"

It takes several tries to try and get an Uber and when you do they deny you.

So be careful witu the drivers. When I had my throat surgery I would send a message to my drivers and tell them I can\u2019t wear a mask but I can cover my mouth with a cloth at best and they tell me it\u2019s fine because it\u2019s not my fault.

I\u2019m frustrated, the driver is frustrated; he shows me the address his GPS recorded, I show him the address entered and recorded on my phone. To add an additional stop or address also creates a problem. In one instance, I entered one change... the driver\u2019s GPS added an additional one. I had to show the driver the entries recorded on my phone. This is very disturbing and could be considered fraud on Uber\u2019s part. Please fix this problem.\nUber walk is the worst idea Uber has so far... to be dropped off in the middle of no where, nor knowing if one should go right or left to get to one\u2019s destination at night, in a strange neighborhood is asking for a disaster to occur.

One person will say I have two outstanding charges due to credit card decline but my history shows they were paid via my Uber credits. Another will say I have no outstanding payments and I should be able use. Another says to logout and log in again and it will be working. Others say \u201cwe are investigating and will provide with you with an update\u201d and then weeks go by without any news. It seems as no one wants to take ownership to solve the problem, and no one reads the previous chat and always asks for \u201ca screenshot detailing your problem\u201d even after I\u2019ve sent many screenshots. I can only imagine what type of \u201csupport\u201d they\u2019d provide if I had a safety issue.\n\nEdit: note how developer says to contact support at URL. That\u2019s the support I\u2019ve contacted many times in the past and isn\u2019t solving the problem. Just another example of how Uber pays lip service to support. At this point, I\u2019d give Uber zero stars if I could."

Using the automated help I discovered several things starting with the fact the email address I signed up with is one I deleted years ago. Eventually I found a place to change email addresses. I filled it out and it informed me it sent a verification email to the old closed account. There is no way to speak or write a human being just the AI idiocy. I can\u2019t create a new account because my phone already is registered. Deleting the app and reinstalling doesn\u2019t help because it doesn\u2019t pay attention to your Apple ID email or I never would have had a problem. Most apps read your email and phone from your phone. Uber isn\u2019t that intelligent. Long ago I had to make my trip today so I ended up having to create a Lyft account and use them. I guess I\u2019m done with Uber since they make it impossible for me to use them or to get human help. One more company that just wants cheap illegal immigrants for help and AI rather than providing jobs for people here legally. Lyft wins."

There have  been several times where the uber Driver was really late or didn\u2019t show up or couldn\u2019t find me and then I would get charged. It shouldn\u2019t be my problem if the uber driver can\u2019t find my address Or it takes 30 minutes when its says it will take 4 min on my app and he keeps getting delayed. I should be able to cancel without a fee and get another driver instead of waiting 30 min or longer. I accept it because the app say 4-7 mins. or else I\u2019ll find alternative transportation so im not late. Absurd that I get charged a cancellation fee when the issue lies with circumstances where I am not at fault.  At least with Lyft you can contact them to let them know the situation so the charge can be reversed. I only continue to use Uber because lyft isn\u2019t  available in Mexico or many other places. But of course Uber probably doesn\u2019t care and they probably won\u2019t do anything to fix this. \nI would have let them know directly but since there is no way to contact them this is my only way of letting them know."

The app is user friendly and I like that I can send my status to my friends. It is somewhat bothersome when a driver can accept my ride whenever he/she is >10 minutes away. This happens to me frequently at the airport and often they cancel because it is inconvenient for them too. So I end up waiting over 20 minutes for an Uber that may or may not cancel on me. I get that I can schedule a ride but it is nearly doubled the price. I don\u2019t fault the driver because I think that it is a system error. Lastly, I honestly wish I could rate my co-riders majority of the time they either keep to themselves or have pleasantries but those other times when they are rude and inconsiderate...well it somehow negatively impacts the driver and it isn\u2019t fair. Anyways I will still use Uber over Lyft but would like to see the issues addressed if feasible. Thanks"

To be honest - I really don\u2019t like the tipping thing- I feel like now it\u2019s really pressured and almost mandatory - your suggestions for $ 3/5/10 is not logical my opinion- sometimes my fair is $10 and to tip another $10?? I\u2019m sorry but I liked Uber because there was no pressure to tip/ you didn\u2019t have to bring cash or worry about that  people should be doing their job because of pride and honor - I hate to say it - but to put a suggested tip- defeats the purpose of your good work ethic. If someone wants to tip- perhaps you guys should get rid of your opinion or suggestion on what others tip. I\u2019m not sure if LYFT uses hear strategies but I\u2019m going to check them out now because I feel every time irritated about your new system.

Uber is no help at all. Ridiculously hard to contact and when they do the respond it is like it\u2019s from a robot. I\u2019m disgusted with how this driver has abused my son and Uber offers no help. They hide behind technology!! No humans answering phones and helping!! Then I call an Uber to go home from a party and after my ride is accepted the driver calls me to ask where I am and where I\u2019m going. Once he determined where I was going he chose to back out of the ride. I was waiting 15 minutes for this ride and I lived 15 minutes away. He wasted my time and made me feel like I did something wrong. I think it\u2019s time Uber get its act together or the government regulates it even more. I will not use Uber again from this point and will make sure my story is heard by others. They don\u2019t have a clue and don\u2019t care!!

Since the update, I find that the app will have riders & drivers being forced to leave locations, which they have to pass anyways to a destination, in order to meet the other party. A perfect scenario of this is when I had a destination set for a certain block. Instead of being dropped at my requested location, I was taken 3 blocks away. It was my observation that the gps then told the driver to drive past my requested drop off point on the way to the next location. I know the driver had to pass this point because I requested to stay in the car, since I saw he was passing my location ANYWAY. Uber has created a new, very unsatisfactory system. I make this review based on experiences from 10+ uber pool trips at different locations & times. This new system is outrageous. The system was better before this recent update which included walking to/from destinations. The walking creates an inconvenience & confusion for uber pool drivers & customers alike.",

I\u2019ve contacted customer service, they\u2019ve just told me that it was because of the authorization fee and they put it on hold and it was voided. When honestly, it really did go through my account and it was clearly deducted. And they\u2019ve said that they don\u2019t have any controls to that. (??) I\u2019ve even sent them screenshots from my bank account and they just told me that maybe someone from my household were also using my account. Impossible! Cause none of my family members nor my friends rides uber than ME, MYSELF & I. And they also said that those charges were from the past rides I\u2019ve been in, maybe? Loool! When in fact, the past rides has also been deducted through my account already. Horrible! I couldn\u2019t believe that one ride will cost you 3x. How?! Why is it like that?!",

Another problem I had was the Uber driver was taking a longer route and then what are you to be expected and I was late for my appointment and I told him to go the way that I needed him to go but he refused to and said that he uses the GPS and I was late for my appointment that was very important and I didn\u2019t end up getting the job for because of being tardy.

I wish that Uber would go back to giving ONE stable price and not charge the rider for little extra miles since it's not our fault the driver takes wrong turns or exits. After all, the driver is WORKING, it's a job, they should be professional enough to not constantly be taking wrong turns and exits since Uber tells them when and where to do so. I would like for Uber to ask before charging me if I allowed this extra miles that the driver took. They have \"add or change\" for a reason and if I didn't add nor changed destination then it's obvious I didn't allowed it.",

I was 15 minutes late to work due to the app not working, uber failed to let me know the ride wasn\u2019t available even 15 minutes outside my pickup window. Then when addressed about it the only solution uber has is to request your rides 30minutes early to give yourself enough time. Stupidest suggestion ever because i always give myself 40-50 minutes of time frame before my actual start time. Disappointing uber cant take responsibility, AND blames the riders for THEIR mistakes. Not to mention, the last 2 weeks my card has been ran 2-3 different times for an authorization hold when the ride was only requested ONCE & still didnt even give me the ride, putting the money in my acct on hold making me unable to even catch a lyft. And of course support always acts as if they cant find the charge because its only being \u201cauthorized & held\u201d NOT THE POINT. YOU SHOULDNT BE RUNNING ANYONES CARD MORE THAN ONCE WITHOUT PERMISSION, thats known as UNAUTHORIZED!! The past few weeks have been nothing but problematic.

If I had to \u201creview\u201d it however, I would say the maps need updating. There are roads that have changed, not so recently, from two-way to one-way. Signs installed that redirect traffic permanently, etc. As an app that focuses entirely on driving, routes, and maximising driver efficiency, staying on top of such things would be paramount. Maybe take a waze approach and have drivers submit closures & outdated routes. Not sure, you can do the r&d. \n\nThat\u2019s me being nit picky tho, uber could be a terrible interface and I would still use it. Safe, kind drivers, quick, and easy to sort. \n\nSide note, uber take 25% of the fare? Seems a bit much for a massive tech giant. Remember that your drivers have kids, hobbies, lives... without them uber wouldn't exist. Generosity goes a long way in the eye of the the 99%.",

I go to request a ride home and my card was declined. Confused i look at my account and see 3 pending authorization charges plus the ride that was taken! How does this happen?! One charge is bad enough but 3 plus the ride?! I had to put even more money in the account just to get home. What if that was my last?

It\u2019s one thing to have people walk a few blocks to make it easier for the driver\u2019s route and save time, but when it gets to being that long of a walk, what is the point of ride? I understand I can change to normal Uber pool, but at this point the prices for that have become so inflated because of the addition of express pool that for someone who used to use Uber nearly every day, it\u2019s becoming impossible to afford. It probably has something to do with GPS algorithm or something, but regardless, that change has made me stop using Uber and switch to lyft a lot more often.. hoping this can be fixed soon...!",

    "review": "The arrival time of the drivers is never accurate! It says, \"1 minute away\" and it always takes the drivers longer than a minute to get to the pick up. If the driver is 5 minutes away, just put that. Don't have me expecting a driver in a minute, when that is not the case. It's worse when the arrival time is saying something like, \"8 minutes away\" and you are waiting up to 15 minutes. \n\nThe drivers never arrive in the time it says they will. One driver was a \"minute away\", and sat in his car at the gas station, and told me that was what he was doing when he picked me up 8 minutes later. There is always glitches in the app. Sometimes it is extremely difficult to get a car in the first place, and when you do they're \"completing a trip nearby\" which is not nearby. They've raised the prices significantly so it's not even an affordable option. The drivers are rude most of the time, but it all depends on the person with this one. Honestly, the service is only good if you are out at night and don't have a DD. It's better than drunk driving!",

Also, this last trip I was waiting 9 mins of an 11 min wait when suddenly my drive canceled the pickup and the replacement Uber driver was again 11 mins away. Then he drove into a parking lot off the street he was supposed to pick me up and then I was charged an $.85 charge for \u201cwait time\u201d! What about my wait time from first driver and then this guy going into parking lot instead of further down street to address of where I was waiting? I\u2019ve stopped tipping because of these fees.

    "review": "I have had Uber for years and have never had the desire to review until now. First, something needs to be done when I driver cancels the trip. If I am charged a fee when I cancel a trip, then I should be given money when they cancel it because it is an EXTREME inconvenience. I was waiting for a driver for 15 minutes and when he was almost here, suddenly it was cancelled. Then I had to find another driver and wait another 15 minutes and at that point, I had missed my appointment. \nMy other major critique is the new \u201cexact price\u201d. This may seem like a good idea, but in practice, it is costing me more money. I no longer get charged on actual kilometers or time travelled, but instead, am given a price in the middle of the usual range and it ends up costing a lot more. A lot of times drivers take different routes or take more/less time to get to the destination than predicted. Please bring back the price range, and base trips on actual distance and time. \nIf these two issues or at least one are addressed, then I will resubmit a positive review.\n\nThank you.",

Somehow the driver ended up going the wrong direction and we hit a toll we shouldn\u2019t have. I said that it seemed like we weren\u2019t going in the right direction so when she got to the other side of the bridge she should turn around. She said she thought we were close so she already accepted another rider and would only be able to take us back on the other side of the toll. She tried to drop us off on the side of the road and the other passenger had to ask her to please pull up to the sidewalk for our safety. We had to walk close to a mile to get to the originally requested destination. I sent a note to Uber support through the app and they did not understand why I was dissatisfied or upset at all. They were only willing to refund me the toll charges even though the driver didn\u2019t get me anywhere near my destination. I am so upset and bothered by their reaction to this unsafe situation that I do not even feel comfortable using Uber going forward.",

There is no phone number to contact for support so I tried to get assistance through the conversation option on the app. It takes forever to get a reply.

I left it at that and waited for my ride to pick me up at the airport. About 30 minutes before my Uber driver was supposed to pick me up, I received a message that my ride was canceled for some reason. I was so so frustrated through this whole process. I doubt I will try to use Uber ever again. So now in a rush, I thankfully was able to find a friend that is willing to pick me up to take me to the airport with such short notice.",

    "review": "I continue to use Uber mainly because they often give me discounts making it significantly cheaper than using Lyft. Some issues I have run into are driver accepting my ride request then going the opposite direction (forcing me to cancel so they don\u2019t hurt their acceptance rate while leaving me stranded and usually making me late). One driver I called to see what was up and as soon as I mentioned Uber, he hung up on me. Me other issue is with the walking pool option. I get what it\u2019s supposed to be but the few times I used it, it\u2019s tried to pick me up/drop me off at a dangerous intersection or had the driver drop me off somewhere sketchy when I was actually going somewhere on the main road. I suppose we can only expect so much of technology but still frustrating and nerve racking. Another issue is the rates not being set like Lyft, allowing the driver to increase your fare by taking a longer route. Irritating when you\u2019re trying to get somewhere in a timely fashion/on a set budget.",

I forgot a set of keys in the car and the only way to contact the driver is through the app with a return format, finally they transferred the call , the driver found it but he couldn\u2019t contact me, no records in his phone.  He is bringing my keys back , of course there is an extra fee of $15 dollars for that service. I am considering to try other company services , there are inaccurate information like the waiting time, distance of your driver  with the marching driver process, the system is just very convenient for them , the driver was waiting for me,  there is a fee for waiting and my phone shows he was 5 minutes away and the message I got was \u201cyour driver will arrive soon \u201c.. now the messages with Uber disappears so  users have no way to keep records of the transactions or error that the company make..",

Firstly, it\u2019s already incredibly passive-aggressive for this app to make me wait 2 minutes for absolutely no reason as it \u201cprepares\u201d my best route. Give me a break. This is just a way to try at my patience so that I will cancel and upgrade to an Uber X. I know there are over a dozen Ubers on my block at any given moment because I see them on the map and with my own eyes. But by god, I find it pretty sick that once my driver is actually selected, suddenly I am made to walk 4+ min to meet my driver who is arriving within 1. The absolute worst was the time when Uber thought I cold teleport 3 NYC avenue blocks (a brisk 8 minute walk for a normal, healthy person) within 2 min to meet my driver. Fortunately I can call the driver in person and explain my predicament so that I\u2019m not left in the dust for being late. They\u2019ve always been kind enough to wait for me. Which goes to show that the actual drivers themselves are decent people. It\u2019s the app that is trash.",

I trusted that if there was any issue I could report it and it would be diligently dealt with, as this was my experience with customer service after 2 negative ride experiences among so many good rides. However, recently the feature to report issues and complaints changed and has become limited. Before there were some categories to choose from and then you would write about the issues experienced, but now there is no option to detail the negative experience and get support for it or be sure it was fully communicated. This DECREASES my TRUST in the app and the company\u2019s care. I would suggest that you switch back to the previous method or add a text option for the customer to be able to provide an explanation of what the problem was with the ride, to ensure you get the full and accurate feedback that enables you to improve the experience",

It has been a while since I have used the app but today when I used it I was supposed to walk five minutes to a pick up location which is down a very steep hill. My girlfriend and I were going into the city for my birthday celebration and she had on heels. First off, if I\u2019m requesting a ride I think it should pick me up at my door step, secondly on the ride home uber tried to drop us off 2 blocks from our house. It was midnight! Not only can that be dangerous for people in general but what about young women!? Why can\u2019t my uber drop me off in front of my door? When I used uber last this wasn\u2019t an issue. I\u2019m very turned off by this new practice and it makes me want to just drive my own car. \n\nUber please look into this issue. I am willing to bet 9/10 customers don\u2019t want to walk 2 blocks for an uber. Especially during the summer.",

Your driver will supposedly come and leave if they don\u2019t see you. Sure, makes sense right. Sometimes it seems like they don\u2019t even come at all, and you will be charged a fee for not showing up. Despite either the driver not showing up or not even waiting a minute for you to get to them. I\u2019ve had numerous times where vehicles were different color than the ones shown on the app and yet I\u2019m the one penalized for not being able to spot the vehicle.\n\nOther than that, Uber has been good so far. It\u2019s low cost to ride. Quick and works like a charm most of the time. I would recommend this app and give it 4 stars if they would cater to riders a little more often. They are currently pretty lax in terms of who can drive and it\u2019s not always a pleasant experience. I haven\u2019t tried Lyft yet so I can not compare.",

My driver was friendly & had a pretty nice, comfortable car that looked almost brand new & had nice leather seats. My advice; if it\u2019s your first time using Uber & you don't mind spending a couple extra bucks go with UberX. It\u2019s only like 2 to 4 bucks more than Pool depending on the distance. This way you wont have to wait longer for an Uber Pool or share a ride. Much cheaper than a Taxi wether you choose Pool or X. A taxi ride from where I had to go would have costed me well in the $30 to $40 price range & probably would have been less as pleasant of an experience compared to Uber.",

When I questioned why he hung up and cancelled my trip. \n\nThe great news is after 15 min of waiting for the driver who cancelled my trip and another 6 minutes for another Uber I had the \u201cBest\u201d Driver and most fascinating conversation. Not only did the Driver get out of his car to pick up my luggage, when we arrived at my destination, he took my 2 suitcases up 2 flights of stairs. His gracious, kind, compassionate behavior was exemplified by his actions...and so it goes from a nightmarish experience to one filled with Joy. Isn\u2019t it Ironic.",

    "review": "Ive been using uber for years now and its never failed to give me a hard time!! Simple tasks become difficult!! There is an occasional good drive but the drivers most of the time are uncooperative or just dont understand english. Theres nothing wrong with having drivers who speak another language dont get me wrong but it becomes seriously difficult when they dont understand a single word your saying!! And uber always makes me cross a dangerous road when i choose the walking option. Its extremely frustrating. The amount of fees i had to pay because a driver didnt know how to work the app or because they didnt have common sense is too many to count\ud83e\udd2c.Somehow the same exact trips i take often become an hour trip when the destination will only be 15-20 minutes away. & You can forget about being on time with this app! The thing to top it all off is now that when i took my card off the app, then tried to put that same card on the next day, its giving me problems when i for sure have money in my account. IM SICK OF THIS APP. THEY NEED TO DO BETTER!!!!",

My complaint right now though is that it is nearly impossible to update your information without being logged into your account, but you need it to be updated in order to log into your account. It\u2019s completely counterintuitive. First I couldn\u2019t log into Jump because I needed to update my phone number, but I couldn\u2019t do so without logging in. So then as a workaround I re-downloaded Uber and logged in using my email. That went about as well as I could reasonably hope for, but then it asked me to enter the information for the debit card that was on file. I don\u2019t have that card with me or even know where it is. The number got stolen so I had to get a new card. So basically I can\u2019t now and probably never will be able to log into Uber or Jump ever again, unless I find a card that I stopped using half a year ago. Couldn\u2019t they just have you answer some security questions like a normal program?",

That being said - I use the \u201cbook ahead\u201d feature a lot. Last night I scheduled a ride for this morning. However I was not notified until the time of my scheduled ride that my payment would not go through (I recently lost my credit card which I am in the process of replacing). Therefore - I had to add a new payment method and book a new ride. I was headed to the airport so I ended up being on a much tighter schedule than I had anticipated. It would have been nice if I had been notified last night that the payment method wouldn\u2019t work so I could worry about it at that time.

Now i don\u2019t personally care if you can\u2019t speak English because America is \u201cfree\u201d country and is diverse. Speak what you wanna speak but if you\u2019re gonna hire people who don\u2019t speak English at leas, AT LEAST, make sure they understand the basics of english! It\u2019s annoying having to break my neck trying to help someone get to me because they don\u2019t understand me and i dont understand them.

After explaining and re-explaining my issue multiple times and having cut-and-pasted and irrelevant info from their website sent back to me, I finally gave up. If I was indeed speaking to a real person, they literally were not reading my emails at all. For example, I was told that the promotion I was using was \u201conly applicable to rides taken between Nov 12th 2018 and Jul 4th 2019, so therefore it was not applicable to my trip.\u201d My trip was scheduled for June 5th, 2019. \n\nAs far as the ride itself, I was very satisfied with our driver, the use of the app for paying, etc. Uber is all good if everything works smoothly, but be prepared for an absolute nightmare if you ever need assistance with anything!"

My driver followed the app to the address which was correct but the Uber gps sent him to the wrong location, a home street behind the hotel, I sent the driver 3 notes and tried to call. But he ignored my call, and messages and canceled the trip. This caused my business card to be charged and now I have to explain  bogus charges on my card and report that to my company. It would be preferable to have my card refunded instead for business travel. \n\nI think it VERY important that I can make a complaint about the driver ignoring my notes and phone calls, but no way to add these notes..."

    "review": "My experience with the drivers and getting rides with Uber are always good, but the customer service if you have an issue with your account could definitely improve. I had someone steal my credit card information and somehow was able to access my Uber account. When I contacted customer service I was not able to find anyway to talk to a person on the phone end it took a very long time to resolve using the messageing system with customer support. I was left unsatisfied with that customer support experience. I also noticed that sometimes drivers don\u2019t make much money at all on a short trip even if they had to drive very far to pick the person up. I would be willing to pay a little more if they have to drive more than 20 minutes to my location. Over all the passengers experience is always great and I will continue to use Uber because of this."

It will tell you seven minutes then it will jump up to 10 minutes and then it will say arriving now. Very in accurate.  \n\nThis evening it said meet your driver now I walk out no one is there so I text them. They replied shortly later and said I\u2019ve arrived but the app still said they were two minutes away\u2026 \n\nI\u2019ve usually been pleased with drivers/cars etc. Tonight decided to Uber because it was so cold and didn\u2019t want to have to park or get into a cold car. When the driver arrived the car was freezing not sure if I was his first ride and it also smelled weird. On the return home, the car again was freezing almost as if the heat wasn\u2019t working or on & the driver barely spoke English. Unfortunately, this was my mom\u2019s first time using Uber and she was the reason I took it. She has had several surgeries and gets cold easily and it\u2019s hard for her to walk far distances.  \n\nI like using Uber  and until this evening have had pretty good experiences. I also have a good rider rating  and would like to keep it that way.  Is there a way that I can request to not have a particular driver/car pick me up again? Hate to seem picky but when I\u2019m spending money I just don\u2019t like to be in a car that smells weird or is cold!\nThank you\nTeresa"

Now it will show you a driver(s) nearby (maybe 2 min away) when you requested a ride - and then when you're connected to a driver, it's a driver who is now 7 min away and is completing another trip.  This didn't happen two years ago. Then the time to arrive will constantly fluctuate up and down by a number of minutes - even as the driver gets close to pick-up. This didn't happen previously either.  Also given the inaccuracy of the mapping, providing just the car type and the license plate isn't helpful if half the cars are the same (say, a Prius in Seattle) or there are no front plates in a state (say, N.Carolina). Adding car color would be helpful to identify an approaching ride.  Also apparently the app no longer shows the driver what side of the street you located.\n\nAll combined, I can't think of one change to a once excellent app that has improved the customer experience."

I still haven\u2019t gotten the refund and after the same driver came to pick me up and I asked him why wasn\u2019t he moving. He said he was already at my house and he doesn\u2019t know why the uber app said he was still at the location he was when he accepted my ride. He said there was something wrong with the Uber app. I swear there\u2019s always something wrong with this app. The location pins be wrong not only with the passengers but with the Uber drivers.

I had a driver once tell me that when the passenger canceled a trip then complained, uber took the cancelation fee from the driver in full to reimburse the passenger. In other words even though they take 20% or whatever percent of the fare. They made the driver fully reimburse the passenger. In addition, Uber takes the most out of the drivers. They charge fees and taxes but when the driver gets their information - they don\u2019t include that the amount the driver receives is post tax so now the driver claims taxes on taxed income. Another thing is their customer service! If you tell them \u201chey, i\u2019m upset my driver accepted my ride and put they arrived AND started my trip but then cancelled\u201d they\u2019ll say \u201csorry for the inconvenience but due to the fact that you weren\u2019t charged, we cannot reimburse you\u201d - then you can say \u201coh i don\u2019t care about the money i\u2019m just upset said driver started the route and now knows my destination without servicing me\u201d they\u2019ll just end your conversation.

I requested a ride that was a 6 minute drive from my location and was matched with a driver 10 minutes away even with other cars in the area. I was charged a fee even though I immediately cancelled because walking would take me less time. On my walk I even walked past an Uber whom was parked and waiting for a request. Lastly, the rides are becoming way more EXPENSIVE lately and 100% of the time it is cheaper to use the local city yellow taxis. Uber used to always be cheaper and was an advantage because of cost and ease of use and services. Although the application and service remains excellent, the cost advantage is no longer there and it is more often than not a few dollars more than a taxi lately."

Once we waited for over 20 minutes and the driver couldn\u2019t find the way and we had to cancel it. The next driver also took longer than usual. Tried to call but the line was always busy. Turned out the driver was on the phone talking to someone. He was on the phone the whole time during our 40-minute trip. Then there was this time when neither the driver nor us could connect to the server and the trip wouldn\u2019t start. Of course the driver wouldn\u2019t go without the trip started and we had to cancel the trip. Not to mention the other day when the app didn\u2019t work for no apparent reason at all. Now this afternoon I couldn\u2019t take a ride due to my Paytm account having \u201cinsufficient funds\u201d, because the 350 Rupees withheld for an earlier trip was not released and I was 0.03 Rupees short. Seriously Uber, do you have to withhold 350 for a trip that costs less than 150? I had over 800 Rupees in my account and couldn\u2019t take two trips that cost about 400.

I did but the money grubbing hog Uber proceeded to say to me I was out of pickup range. So the driver said I had to cancel and request again. I did and the same driver now comes to me. I get charged over $6 for Uber complete screw up. I cannot find how to ever speak to anyone or get any response to any issue with Uber. This is terrible customer service and if Uber does not fix this and contact me I am going to explain this to all I can reach on social media. This is the last straw for me on Uber screwing me out of money for their complete failure. At this point it appears that it is all calculated and targeted extra charges and a planned money stream. Cancellation charges for not showing up or sending the driver to the wrong place is fraud and I have had it. What say you Uber?"

I spent my day doing all I could to cheer myself up and stay distracted. Syed picked me up while I was on the phone with a friend talking about my devastation. After I hung up he immediately asked me if I was okay and if there was anything he could do for me. He was kind, gave incredible advice, but most of all I appreciate his honest human qualities. He really took the time to talk to me and make me laugh. It was one of the best conversations I have ever had. And I think Uber really needs to reward someone for that. Not everyone can do what he did. I felt broken that day and he helped build me back up. I\u2019m incredible grateful that he was my driver. Who knew I could\u2019ve needed him as much as I really did. I am so thankful.",

I am really saddened that you would think that I am trying to get money from Uber by falsely making statements of how my service was with your drivers!!! I thought that maybe just maybe someone would take a look at the complaints and see that I was trying to get my information corrected so that there would be no more problems.

I was running late for an event so I had to cancel and re-request an Uber to get there on time (which eventually arrived). They later charged me $5.25 for a cancellation fee. I issued a dispute for this charge since the cancellation was entirely the cause of the driver who did not show up. The fee was eventually refunded to me via PayPal.  This was in January 2020. In June, I decided to give Uber eats a try (I usually use Postmates) and placed an order. While submitting what I thought was a payment for my food, I get a confirmation that stated that I had paid the $5.25 from the \u201ccancelled\u201d ride in January! This has left a bad taste in my mouth for all Uber services. It is not about the money but the principle. Uber needs to create better pathways for customers to address a no show ride so that they don\u2019t end up charging people months later. \n\nShame on you.",

I overheard someone talking about the Uber driver kicking her off the car bcuz the person did not have a car seat.. well what if we need to go to the grocery store and we need an Uber ride? Are we going to have to lug a toddler car seat around in the store while we try to run that errand that we desperately needed to do... I have also experienced being able to ride in an Uber with my toddler without a car seat and I know this is illegal. But the driver did not know this information.. UBER PLEASE GIVE US & drivers the option to provide a car seat for us or the option on the app to let the drivers know we have kids that will be riding. I really like Uber for those times in need, the only thing it lacks is the child option to ride.",

This may be a Logan Airport peculiarity but since I fly out of Logan 2-3 times each month, this is problematic. Also a return flight just a day ago had both the limo and Uber services pick up their passengers in the same pickup area. Awkward. And per usual, it took 17 minutes to get a response out of Uber.

Along with that, I wish that if the driver canceled on you, they were penalized in the way of cash rather than their star rating. Because i know that there are people that have 5 stars, cancel one trip and they got canned for it. It\u2019s not an uncommon thing. But, just overall a better way to run your business would be good.

It used to be one of my first choices, but now it\u2019s become quite the last resort.\n\nWhenever I request a pool (being that they\u2019re generally cheaper than an X or other versions) I have to wait anywhere from 10-20 minutes for my driver to arrive because for whatever reason the drivers that receive my request are always coming from the complete other side of the city. And even then, it takes minutes before I\u2019m actually connected to a driver. What happened? I used to wait probably two to seven minutes to be picked up, so that\u2019s quite a significant difference. \n\nCalling an X can be a nightmare because of the outrageous rates nowadays as well. I remember it used to be more or less $7-$10 to get to most places in my city, but now it often costs upwards of $15-$20. \n\nI understand there are a lot of factors that contribute to these differences, like traffic and demand, but I can\u2019t help but feel like there could definitely be some work done so that this service appeals to everyone rather than those who can easily spend $20 on a 15 minute ride without worry.",

There used to be a rating system here, but fairly recently (around April 2019) they have removed the ability to rate your driver, but strangely they can still rate you. I heard a rumor once that they give you a bad rating for not tipping; I am glad it\u2019s not like America where your rating actually matters. Here in Bahrain I could literally have a 0.00 rating and nobody would look twice. Another thing I have to say is a fair amount of these drivers can\u2019t read or speak English.

Are you really pairing riders for the most efficient route if the driver must drive 14 minutes in the opposite direction?

    "review": "I ordered my Uber yesterday to go pick up my car from the auto shop. The place was closed and one of the guys was kind enough to meet me there after I got off work. I was connected with a driver named Dawn and it said she was in another drop off and would be en route to me in 9 minutes. So I waited patiently as I watched her drop off her ride 5 minutes away from me. I watched the little Uber car move towards my turn (at this point let the car guy know what time I would be there). Then I saw her pass each little turn she had the opportunity to take to pick me up. She then proceeded to park in a residential area and wait. I can only assume she wanted me to cancel so she could still get the fee. So I waited. She was supposed to get me at 623pm for a 645/7 arrival to my destination. She canceled the ride finally around 643. Connecting me to a new rider. I canceled the ride to find another way to my destination to no avail. Was forced to order another Uber. He actually showed up and it was a very pleasant ride. Unfortunately Dawn has ruined Uber for me and I will not be a returning customer.",

They make it so difficult to contact them with your exact problem, as they don\u2019t provide an \u201cuber support\u201d email. Also, I recently left a key in an uber. He was nice enough to inform me that he had it, told me where he was, and I proceeded to meet him at HIS location to get it back. Not until later that day did my charge go up $15 for him having to \u201creturn the item\u201d (it said the entirety of that fee would go to him). This was ridiculous, and I feel strongly that he was just using it as an excuse to make more money. Obviously with Uber\u2019s lack of customer support, I still had to pay the fee.

The first Uber to my destination was only $22 but when I requested another to go back home, it charged me $45. It\u2019s ridiculous because why would it cost $22 AND $45 to go the same exact distance. I\u2019m using Uber more because of the pandemic but these price gauges is outrageous and is the first time I\u2019ve ever paid $40+ anything for a 20 minute ride.\n\nAnd don\u2019t get me wrong, I understand the situation is a bit unique but the fact that they initially told me my ride would be between $19 and $25 but then changed it to $45 is just crazy because that\u2019s $20 I may not have had. I put in a complaint and they gave my $11 \ud83d\ude11 like they could have at least gave me half of what they stole like $15 or something. I use Uber A LOT and now I\u2019d rather take the bus.

She was intending on dropping off this second person before I spoke up and voiced how unhappy we were about driving all over and picking up and dropping off people while we are still sitting in the car after a very long flight. She decided to drop us off next. We arrived at our hotel over 1 1/2 hours after we were picked up! She said it was Uber\u2019s fault because they tell her where to go... but couldn\u2019t she have refused at least one of those other rides? Either way this is totally unacceptable!

    "review": "Uber is the absolute worst of the rider apps.  If you\u2019re in nyc, use Via.  Anywhere else, use Lyft or absolutely any other app.  Uber drivers are fine, but the app will give you unrealistic arrival times of your driver (My last Uber said it would take 10 minutes to get to me and took more than 20 - so I missed my train, even though I paid for an uberx that estimated my arrival long before my train).  This is of no fault of the driver, as this is a consistent issue.  Uber is also more expensive than any other riding apps. AND, if you try and cancel because you can see that you\u2019re going to miss your train and it\u2019s not worth going to the station anymore, they charge you even though it\u2019s been more than double the time promised, unlike other rider apps that give you a full refund when they screw you over.  In summary, if you HAVE to Uber for a 10 minute drive, make sure you leave 30 min ahead of time or you\u2019ll end up sitting in the cold rain for an hour waiting for the next train.  Maybe it\u2019s better in other countries but Uber absolutely bites in America.",

Also the riders are sometimes really creepy or I can\u2019t communicate well with them (which I have no problem with but then they get mad which isn\u2019t my fault) I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just really unfortunate because my rides cost quite a bit because I\u2019m on the outskirts of town and I tip well so I feel I haven\u2019t deserved the attitude a good 7/10 drivers give me. Some people working for this app really do not belong and I feel they need to do a video call interview or something before letting them drive for uber.",

As a customer, I\u2019ve found more often than not that their critics are correct: Uber doesn\u2019t screen their drivers as thoroughly as the other guys, their drivers habitually avoid their customers and wait to get the no-show fee while in fact it\u2019s THEY who don\u2019t show up, and though they have the opportunity to be the global company that delivers a great experience, they in fact succeed only in accomplishing a global system of poor service. Of course there are good things about them, and some drivers are truly incredible because of what they bring to the table, but this is mere happenstance from the benevolence of humans, not from a company that strives to deliver a great experience everywhere. Uber can\u2019t even bring themselves to comment or reassure their customers in the face of scandals, frequently \u201cnot being able to be reached for comment,\u201d or replying to such a request.

He asked my son age. I told him he was 5 and a half. He told us that we didn\u2019t tell him that we have a kid. He then added by law the kid has to be 7 to drive without a car seat so he refused to give us a ride. There is no way for us to know that internationally. Top it of Uber app didn\u2019t let the customer know by screening or asking questions. We always use taxi and drivers never ask my son age. Any how I was charged with a $10 fee for cancellation the trip. This is rediculous because we didn\u2019t cancel the pickup, the driver did! \nMy suggestion to Uber app would be to add a note to let the customer knows to specify the kid age so their drivers know to either refuse the pick up immediately or ensure their drivers have a car seat for child per local international laws.",

Perhaps this is typical of my home in West Midtown, Atlanta, but every time I request an Uber, the driver does not know where to get me. I set the pickup location quite clearly, yet I see the driver, almost every time, turning around several times \"1-2 minutes away from me\" before finally getting to me. They are usually late, and the \"X minutes away from you\" indicator is almost always wrong.\"\n\nFurthermore, today it was raining. I called an Uber, she came, and as I approached the car, she rolled down the window to ask if I was receiving a call from her. This added about 5 seconds of rain time before I could get in the car. I understand concerns of safety, etc., but rain is rain, and typically when I approach a car and obviously acknowledge I am supposed to get in (and similarly the driver signals as well) I expect the door to be unlocked. I both felt unwelcome in the car, and was far more wet than I should have been. It was raining hard. This is bad customer service.\n\nAgain, I will reiterate that I love Uber and generally think it is fantastic as an app once I get in the car, but I am generally dissatisfied with pickups, as I have had repeated issues with them.",

It has been good since recently I\u2019ve this terrible terrible experience with the Uber driver who kicked me and my friend out on the street miles away from our destination at 2:30am. The reason he kicked us out was because my friend was feeling sick in his car. She threw up when the car pulled over. Yes. So the vomit got in the car accidentally while she opened the door and threw up on the curb. But did we say we wouldn\u2019t pay the fare or cleaning fee? No. Then what\u2019s the reason of kicking two girls out in the middle of the night while yelling \u201cGet our of my car\u201d then charge a $150 cleaning fee which I didn\u2019t even get the service that I paid for?\n\nThis was a very unsafe trip with this unprofessional driver and it discredits my impression with the whole Uber community. I reached out Uber and all they did was to refund the $5.78 trip fare to me. This is ridiculous. I\u2019m still charged fo the $150 cleaning fee which from a trip I was abandoned on the street. I hope all Uber rides will never have experience like this.",

Uber charges me for rides they NEVER do because they do not show up then they charge me saying I cancelled when I NEVER cancelled the driver just doesn\u2019t show up.. now today they charge me for a ride that was not me and the driver Oscar dropped this person off at a location by my house but was not me so someone got a free ride on my account... NOT FAIR and going to file a complaint with the board.. I\u2019m sick of being ripped off by UBER... it\u2019s basically the drivers that if they don\u2019t feel the ride is long enough where they do t make any money they will accept the ride when it is called in but then they don\u2019t show up and tell the company the party didn\u2019t show up and then the charge the customer... this is not right!! Something has to be done about this... Uber is making BIG money off the drivers cheating the customers!!",

Prices were fair and routes were pretty straight forward before  and in a case where someone had to be picked up you still would end up getting dropped off at around the same time the app would say. Now prices are way too high even if you\u2019re going 5 minutes away and the time it takes to make it to your destination is twice as long. No way in hell that if it takes me 20 minutes to drive to my destination Uber should take 50 minutes, come on now. This is supposed to be fast and convenient. I\u2019ve been late to work on a daily basis because this app states I\u2019ll be at my location on times and there\u2019s always about 5 other rides going on at the same time as mine.

Pretty disappointing for a massive hailing firm! Why don\u2019t you try to book trip from a place other than ur current location and at another time like the next day and try to pick someone else on your way to your destination? Why don't you try to see what car options are available to choose from? U have to accept whatever crapy car you are assigned to, most of them dirty never been vacuumed full of dog hair and u get to sit on those seats with your business suit? \nThis is why Uber can and if not improved will loose to competition.

The second, and last problem, is that Uber could afford to be slightly more cost efficient for those of us who use it almost regularly. Buying a pass seems to be ineffective and essentially rounds out what the general cost would be without the pass. Besides both of these things, I do like Uber. \n\nOn the plus side, the drivers are very friendly, with clean vehicles and safe driving.

They claim that \u201cthe fare can change due to traffic or time taken\u201d or whatever, but nothing ever justifies the fare I\u2019m shown at the end, which often is double what I was shown upfront, and all I did was go from A to B. I took Uber for years and only recently did this start being the case (supposedly). If the fare almost doubling for no reason at all was just going to start being a thing, they should have sent out an email about it because I never would have agreed to these fares, and it\u2019s unfair to trick customers like that. Definitely using a different app.",

I indicated my home as the pick up place and 1379 east Elizabeth street in Pasadena as the destination.  After being cramped in a small Lief car because we are in a \u201cpool\u201d service, he dropped us off on the corner of Catalina and Elizabeth streets which is 3 blocks away from our destination.  He said that because we are on pool status that is where he should drop us off instead of on the actual address.  After an hour-long trip and with my knee problem, walking the 3 blocks was complete torture.  This trip cost us $33+    If this is the kind of service your drivers provide to handicapped senior citizens, I think I have just done my first and last trip using UBER \nI would like to add that the two young passengers who rode with us earlier were brought directly to their doorsteps while these two handicapped seniors were dropped off THREE BLOCKS  AWAY from their destination.

I tried to use the pickup point version but the map display was incredibly poor.  No street names on map, my position not at all clear, no way for me to pick a point and walk to it cleanly and clearly with photo landmarks and something to confirm that I am walking in the correct direction.  After I walked a block in the noon sun the app put up a large blue area circle without any explanation of what it was for.  It became even less clear where or what in this city I was supposed to go for my car.  At that point I canceled and walked back to where I started and ordered an UberX.  Two dollars more but a nice clean car, safe, good driver Estrella, and no-problem ride.  The pickup-point app needs a lot of work; right now even paper bus maps are better.",

Maybe poor \nCellular service in the area also compound the problem and of course the automatic directions on the app telling us where to go were wrong since taxi drivers said Uber was not allowed to pick up at taxi stand. \nWe will never again use Uber at less well known locations until we are convinced you can provide better service.",

For example there are some double decker roads in Chicago and it has shown the route to make a turn from one road to the other that cross over each other and do not intersect. Routinely the app tries to get drivers to make U-turns which are illegal in Chicago, so it seems they need to improve their navigation to improve the customer experience and keep drivers from getting tickets. \n\nMy greatest grievance is the false advertising of wait times. There is a perpetual 6 minute wait that after happens. In reality the wait time starts out really low like 3 minutes but than increases to about 6 for 6 minutes until the car arrives 9 minutes later. \n\nI do love watching the car do the electric slide all over the map and Tokyo drift around corners in slow motion, except when it looks like the driver passed me up, so that could also use improvement.",

This worked great until I had to change my destination after already being picked up. The driver made the change in his app because I did not have service. The problem happened when he dropped me off but didn\u2019t terminate the ride and continued to drive many times the distance I had hired him for. I ended up being charged several times more than I should have for the distance. I submitted a complaint and the responses I received from Uber\u2019s customer service were clearly boiler plate responses which were not even related to my complaint. I asked them multiple times to actually read my complaint and respond to my issue but I just kept receiving the same unrelated responses. Now they are not even responding to me anymore.

The user experience however could be improved on the side of the UberPool feature that requires you to walk to a certain location based on the most convenient route to maximize the drivers efficiency. It makes sense to have you walk a block or two if your location is out of the way of the ideal route for the driver. It does not make sense to have you walk up a hill after your driver drops you off and then said driver commences driving up that very same hill passing your preferred location on the way. The location is not in any major intersection and just as easily could have been a drop off point.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a fault of the driver but more so of the technology that determines the drop off point. This definitely needs to be improved to make continuing to use the app worth it.",

Weird money just disappears in your Uber cash account\n\nI tried to apply Uber cash for payment they just didn\u2019t let me select it and didn\u2019t tell me anything about need to fill up. Which is a different process since last time.. feel ripped off since the process wasn\u2019t explained.

I complained about it but Uber did not have any info of both rides. \n\n  UBER customer support is the worst I\u2019ve ever seen/used.  The categories simply don\u2019t apply to a lot of things.  Not to mention, they have to ask me for information of the ride (i.e drivers name, pick up address, date and amount charged.)  I don\u2019t understand how they don\u2019t have the information on their end.  But they most definitely have my credit card information.

So I ended up being an hour late to work and that\u2019s just not acceptable. On top of that, they charged me 5 dollars for \u201ccanceling and for my drivers time\u201d but what about my time? I lost money because I was an hour late due to extremely poor navigation issues and something seriously needs to be done about this."

I also wish there were more options for why we decided to rate a driver badly. Manners or attitude has been a huge one for me and I always have to click \u201cother\u201d and then submit it. Also, I wish that we, as riders, could see why the drivers say about us so that maybe we could improve our rating. I wish we could read what drivers say about us when they rate us."

The driver was convinced I was going to get sick, to which I suggested he pull over and I would get a different ride, he refused! We safely made it home, however the next morning I was charged for \u201cthrowing up\u201d in his vehicle. First and foremost, I didn\u2019t get sick. Secondly, I reached out to uber to which they responded with photos of what looked like water stains? - what happened here was the driver was tired of driving, took advantage of my illness, wouldn\u2019t pull over so I could get a different ride, and then I was charged the most you can get charged for a cleaning fee. Just because you have my card info does not allow you the right to charge me, this is stealing in fact. I immediately deleted the app as this is not only terrible customer service, but also completely wrong. DO NOT USE UBER! If I could give them negative stars I would."

However, it seems that nobody on that end values customers enough to find a solution. I have already spoken to Amex and they assure me that my card is not restricted and should receive the benefits. Uber customer service will not even respond to an email from Amex sent to the Uber ambassador. What do I have to do to get this resolved contact Uber\u2019s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi directly? I shouldn\u2019t have to take it this far for something that the app explicitly states should be given. I don\u2019t have this problem with Lyft. It accepts chase cards and you are automatically enrolled in the benefit without any issues. Your assistance with this matter will be greatly appreciated."

Called Uber for a ride to the Raleigh/Durham airport as all the parking lots were full and I came home to pick up an Uber ride. The driver/drivers cancelled on me three times. This was incredibly stressful as I work for a major air carrier out of IAD. My flight was the last flt to DC leaving at 3 and here it was already 2:30. Finally one of my friends came to get me and I arrived at RDU with no minures to spare and was boarded with fellow travelers just in time. I was communicating with driver by leaving him texts as to my apt location and how I needed to get to the airport quickly. Just when I think he is minutes away, it would change and he would drive in the opposite direction. I wish I had taken the car and driver info so I could report him to you. I still use Uber as it is a necessity, but I was very mad and upset which is no way to start the beginning of the holiday and my trip. Just needed to vent, other-wise my experiences have been very positive. Thanx for hearing me out. JS"

What blows my mind in a negative way is that the app doesn\u2019t give a push notification like everything else saying that the driver is at your pick up location. You either have to watch the app like a hawk to see ON THE SCREEN that the driver is there or some are nice enough to message you that \u201cI have arrived\u201d.

Uber should create some flag to identify when a driver cancels a trip instead of erroneously punishing the customer by charging a $5 cancellation fee. This is extremely inconvenient for the customer because the customer has to write a complaint to seek a refund. If the customer is too busy and doesn\u2019t have time to write to customer service, then Uber gets to keep the money they incorrectly took from the customer. Additionally, last year Uber\u2019s bot response was so flawed because instead of using me a refund, I was blamed for the driver cancelling my time when I waited for him the entire time. Not only did I wasted my time waiting for him, I was charged $5 when he cancelled. This further delayed my trip.

    "review": "I stopped using Uber last year and decided recently to give them another shot.  I quickly learned that Uber has a 50% chance of either being perfectly fine or an absolutely terrible experience.  You\u2019re taking a gamble whenever you use the app.  In a span of less than two weeks, I was charged a bogus \u201creturn item fee\u201d and a bogus \u201ccancellation fee\u201d.  Both instances were messed up.\n\nThe \u201creturn item fee\u201d must have been some error or mistake by the driver.  After all how can you charge someone a \u201creturn item fee\u201d when the driver didn\u2019t have anything to return?  Nor did the driver return to the drop off location or contact me to return anything.  Uber ended up refunding me thank goodness.\n\nThe \u201ccancellation fee\u201d experience was just odd.  I provided the pickup and destination addresses but the driver chose to go to another pickup address.  The app kept bouncing between showing his eta of 2 mins and then saying he had arrived and was leaving soon.  He did not even bother to come to the address I provided then cancelled the drive even when I called him.  Then Uber charged me a cancellation fee.  I\u2019ve been back and forth with customer service on this.  \n\nBoth experiences are just really disappointing.  I\u2019m fine with getting hit with a fee if I am at fault for something but I\u2019m not cool with getting penalized after doing nothing wrong.",

    "review": "TL;DR \nRide prices fluctuate (sometimes ridiculously), difficult to find ride, drivers intentionally cancelling and being unprofessional in-front of passengers.\n\nTo begin, I used to take Uber every day to get to work. I found that the pay was fair and the drivers were enjoyable. Over time however, the service became more of a headache. What started as a $7 trip to work soon fluctuated to anywhere between $10 and $14, not including a tip. It became difficult to request a ride sometimes, despite there being drivers in the immediate area. If that weren\u2019t bad enough, my most recent experience was with a driver who got to the top of my road, cancelled, and then when I re-requested him again, not even two minutes down the road, he cancelled again, not stopping or slowing down. I was able to get another driver, who spent at least 5-10 minutes in a Burger King drive thru and proceeded to eat during my 5 minute drive, which is very unprofessional.",

Come to find out that the car was reported stolen. They released myself and the young lady, but I was still charged for the trip (which was $9.16 even though I wasn\u2019t even at my location). I had to then call another Uber, pay more money just to get to where I needed to get to.

Happens too often that i request an Uber for a reasonable price, have a driver accept that is over ten minutes away, which in some cases is far too long to wait, for instance when you\u2019re on your way to class or work, causing me to cancel and search for someone closer. When I go to find a new driver to the same location, quite literally a minute later, the price has gone up significantly. This morning I had an UberX go from $22 for a ride across San Francisco, to $37 in the same 60 seconds. Sometimes Uber is my only option of transportation. I think it\u2019s unfair to have prices go up and down in such a way. Constantly checking uber for ten minutes will guarantee a better price but will result in being 15 minutes late to class.

In both DC and NYC it was a hassle to try and find a big dog friendly driver- I had a big towel for my dog and he was great for our Uber drivers. And those that were dog friendly got a big cash tip. Uber and pet friendly drivers could be making quite a bit more on their base if they implemented something like this and if they upcharged for it.",

Recently my Uber account was hacked. I immediately notified Uber. They then sent me a link to change my password, but unfortunately the hacker changed the phone number on the account so I am not even able to change my password. I have been trying to gain control of my account now for over two weeks without the help of Uber who I have been trying to communicate with via email because they don\u2019t even have a direct phone number. I have been given the run around so many times it is ridiculous. Right now I just want to gain control of my account again so I can dissolve my account. So disappointed in this company!!!!!\n\nUPDATE: Uber confirmed my account has been hacked by someone in Russia and still has not helped me gain control of my account. I have had to contact the attorney general to help me with my case.",

I find it to be a quite good app. But I have one major complaint about it. \nHow\u2019s it possible that when you cancel an uber after a certain period of time (I believe it\u2019s 3-5 min), they charge a fee for the trip you aren\u2019t making, but when an Uber cancels your trip after 10 minutes, not only do they \u201cpunish\u201d the driver in some way (charge them a fee), but also they don\u2019t let you rate your driver for cancelling your trip after making you wait just to cancel the trip in the end. \nI find it rather annoying, and it certainly is. I\u2019m sure nobody wants to lose an appointment or a job interview just because your driver figured he didn\u2019t want to take you to your destination after 10 minutes of having confirmed it. If you are an Uber driver, you should just do what you are here to do, which is drive. If you don\u2019t want to go to a certain place, just don\u2019t accept the trip ffs.",

The driver did not speak any English, so I was unable to communicate to him what happened. Instead, he started driving in the other direction and picked up 2 other fares before realizing the app was never going to drop me off and letting me enter my address in his phone. I was finally dropped off an hour and a half after I\u2019d been picked up (it was supposed to be a 20-30 minute trip, even with other riders). I contacted Uber\u2019s customer service reps who respond with obviously prewritten replies that do not address the content of my messages and state that, because I was marked as dropped off (at the wrong address!) the trip was within the estimated time provided - seems like their customer service dept is designed to frustrate you into submission rather than legitimately address riders\u2019 concerns.",

I called my doctor to see if I could still make it, but they said it was best to reschedule. I informed the driver of this and asked him to let me out. I live on 141st street in Manhattan. I got out at 135th street in Manhattan. The Uber charged me for the entire fare of going to 57th street. I was not in the car, the driver did not close out my ride when I got out. He lied on the app, saying I got out at a location I did not depart from. Just to make a few extra bucks. \n\nI informed Uber about this and thought they would reimburse me the difference. They are currently telling me that I entered in the wrong location and they are not making any adjustments. \n\nBusinesses that do well are built on foundations of trust and respect.

Some play it is dumb claiming they can't find the pickup location or they keep reassigning new pickup location when we just finished walking to the previous one they have requested.  Others are more direct and they just cancel the ride all together.

I should never have to walk to meet a driver if I am waiting in the correct, designated pick up spot. I understand that Uber credits my account back if I dispute the charge but the frustration of waiting for a new driver still remains. Especially if the price is higher than when originally requested. Sometimes I wait 20-30 minutes to reorder a ride because there will be surge prices.

Especially in the winter, we\u2019re paying more to order an Uber for the conscience over public transportation, not so we can wait even long and walk over blocks that didn\u2019t even need to be walked!!

I have long days at work and I always am the last person to get dropped off when I am literally on the way to drop off the next person. This is unfair and a waist of time and gas. This should be fixed/ solved a soon as possible. I am not the only person the thinks this, most Uber drivers think this too. The drivers are great 95% of the time but the way the app works is outrageous. Now lets talk about the GPS For Uber drivers, it\u2019s useless the GPS gets lost easily and a 10 min ride turn in to a 15-20 min ride because the GPS goes out of its way to take the longest route possible and again this is a waist of time and gas.

    "review": "I was trying to use Uber for a morning flight to the Guadalajara airport. Apparently, drivers aren\u2019t informed of their destination until they arrive to pick someone up; two drivers in a row cancelled just as they were about to pull into the hotel. Someone working at the hotel got me a taxi and explained why the drivers kept canceling. The taxi was about 50% (about $8USD) more expensive, but I didn\u2019t end up missing my flight. There\u2019s no way to communicate with (much less rate) the driver once the trip is cancelled; both drivers had ratings of 4.9. The question is: why not just inform the drivers before they accept the ride & raise the fare until a trip out to the airport is worth someone\u2019s time? Isn\u2019t that the whole point of a variable-fare system? I\u2019ve never had this problem with Lyft \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if that platform works differently from the drivers\u2019 end. In the future, I\u2019ll just use Lyft where it\u2019s available & taxis where it\u2019s not. An unreliable ride-hail app is pretty worthless.",

Everything seemed to be working fine until I tried to order a ride, when I realized the family profile wouldn\u2019t show as a payment option.  I proceeded to try and register my credit card but found that after I put in the details and ordered the ride, I had to scan my card to verify it.  However because my card has the numbers on the back of it, it wouldn\u2019t scan and I couldn\u2019t order a ride anyways.  Later I reopened the app to try again and the family payment option was finally there.  So I selected it and pressed order, when it asked me to verify and scan a card on family payment, when I was not the owner of the account and hence didn\u2019t even own the payment method.  A lot of researching at this point brought me to the conclusion that, sorry, this massive organization can\u2019t bother to spend the tiniest bit of effort refining their app.",

The charges were obviously not mine because I\u2019ve never hailed rides in Russia.

My next step was to call the credit card company and have them suspend and recover the money charged to my account. That\u2019s when I assume that Uber did not like what I did. I was essentially kicked-out of using this s\u2022\u2022\u2022ty and disreputable app. Beware, Uber takes ZERO RESPONSIBILITY if your account gets hacked. Oh and by the way, if you are wondering if Uber ever answered back saying why I was blocked the answer is NO. Avoid this app, it\u2019s not worth going through all this trouble especially when it\u2019s a problem that pertains to their technical engineering.

So what do I do I rely on Uber to give me a ride and ima let you know this isn\u2019t my first or last time using Uber. I make the order and tells me to wait about 6 min and he comes within 13 min. I\u2019m already late and I come in and the driver says \u201chello, how old are you.\u201d And I\u2019m like umm excuse me and he ask he tells me  \u201cI said how old are you.\u201d I\u2019m honest and i tell him I\u2019m 17 he tells me to get off and cancel the order which charges me 5 dollars to cancel the ride.

Uber map app is wrong about 20% of the time.  Whether it is my pickup location wrong, or the route to my destination once I do get picked up.  Very bad in Orlando.  Maybe 30% wrong.  3.) When I order uber the cars are late versus what the app tells me about half the time.  Most of the time this is OK, but sometimes when I\u2019m in a hurry it causes stress. Also when I order uber ahead for next morning the cars arrive at the latest time or late over half the time.  That\u2019s it.  \nWill remain a heavy uber user.

I've had multiple rides where the driver is accepting the ride then staying in the exact same spot or driving around near my location and not actually coming. Eventually I have to cancel the ride. Of course the driver gets a free $5 and I have to wait for another uber. And every time I try to contact uber they say that it's in accordance with their standards! Not to mention once I was charged $15 for a driver \"returning an item\" which never actually happened. I've had multiple cases where drivers are suggestive or rude. I use uber because after a terrible accident driving makes me too anxious. I've had drivers I felt drove way too fast. When I left a review and wanted to report them (because I asked him to slow down and he didn't) uber said according to their tracker he went an appropriate speed. Don't waste your time they will steal from you. This company cares about the sleazy drivers more than the customers hands down.",

The Uber technical team *please* read this review and take this feedback into consideration in order to update your app. It is such an easy-to-understand feature and I have lost thousands of Uber credits because I cannot use them. As you know, Amex partners with Uber and issues monthly Uber credit for eligible cards. These Amex credits are supposed to expire at the end of the month in which they are issued. However, the current Uber app applies credit for rides/UberEats in a \u201cpredetermined\u201d order and applied Uber Cash (which will never expire) first, and Amex credit (which expire first) the last. This is a BUG that needs to be fixed. And I have lost thousands of credit due to expiration and being unable to use them towards Rides/UberEats orders.

    "review": "Hello - I have been using Uber for over 4 years now and primarily been using for airport rides. Experience has been good until recently where I was charged almost $95 for a trip to the airport (scheduled ride) while the night before I was quoted $67-$77. Oddly enough Uber notified of the price change (and even that was only $87) approx 30 mins prior to the pick up and as I always do, I\u2019ve compared the fare with Lyft and noticed that they have kept the fare to under $67 for the same ride. The problem I have is the transparency and the fact that users are notified so late, users can\u2019t make the switch. Additionally, Uber\u2019s support has had many issues with lack of ability to speak to someone regarding the issue. Super disappointed and if it wasn\u2019t for AMEX platinum with Uber benefits, I would\u2019ve completely switched to Lyft at this point.

So we called Uber and driver was less than a mile away.. After 5 mins, we sent him text to ask if he is coming, and he said of course he is... Then we waited 20 mins but ne never showed up! and we took screenshot almost every minute to show that the driver is not moving even though he is 2mins away...\nAfter 20 mins ride was cancelled, we were charged $5 for cancellation, it felt very bad but finally we had evidence to bring this scam uber\u2019s attention...\nAnd after writing to support and sending all evidence; they said they cannot do anything and even though we tried to elevate, their customer service was the worst we ever seen... \nWe still have all the evidence about this UBER SCAM, until it becomes CLASS ACTION SUIT!!

If you\u2019re going to make someone walk a significant distance already, at least have them cross one more street to spare all of the riders another loop of traffic. Please fix algorithms. Additionally, the app does not allow you to pay for a ride partially with uber cash and credit card. So if you have insufficient funds in cash, it automatically defaults to card which leaves your residual cash in purgatory much like metrocards for the NYC MTA until you add more funds...

I have no idea what the cause is, whether it be drivers leaving due to poor compensation or a change to Uber\u2019s algorithms that pair riders with drivers, but it is no longer convenient to use.\n\nIn addition, uber has intentionally made it nearly impossible to contact customer service about issues. Unless something fits into their preselected categories, you can\u2019t do much about it (no email, live chat or phone number available). Using the in-app preset categories is not very useful even when you have a trip issue.",

I, or shall I say, people Uber as a better option to another alternative and that was missed in a big way. Uber should require the drivers to report whether they have an EZpass or now so the rider knows what they are getting and a way for the rider to choose if they want to accept the fees should the driver choose the toll route. In this case, I would\u2019ve selected that I would\u2019ve only got in the car with a rider who had an EZpass. The hour long commute I was trying to avoid so that I could get home my child so that my mom could catch her flight was even longer in the Uber. This was because he didn\u2019t have an EZPASS, so the ETA Uber provided me was completely misleading. What was said to be a 30 minute ride turned into an hour PLUS. This is a major gap that I hope Uber addresses. Also no customer service number for riders....if I could give a negative star I would.",

I was discouraged from cancelling the ride to find someone that\u2019s closer to me because of the cancellation fee, but this needs to be waived when the amount of time it takes for the uber to get here increases when the driver remains in the same area. I tracked this man\u2019s progress towards my home and he was stopped at one place for at least five minutes on his way over. There was no traffic."

In the 3 years of using it I have NEVER recurved any discount codes at ALL despite my 4.95 rating (mind you I use this consistently around 12 times a week on average. I have also noticed that uber charges ME MORE compared to my friends or family from the exact same location as Uber\u2019s algorithm knows I have paid more in the past. Uber knows I am a loyal customer out of need but instead of lowering the prices by offering me discounts for my use they charge me more as they knows I will pay. I cannot wait until there are more independent companies offering ride-share come about because Uber clearly does not care about its customers despite many of them needing this service to either make a living or move around in their daily lives. Shame on you uber. This is why I now primarily use Lyft now. You have lost a loyal customer. I suggest more people do the same."

I have had many bad experiences with this app and customer service and kept using it because it was slightly cheaper than the alternative. Well, yesterday I had a ride that almost made me miss my train because the Uber driver took many wrong turns and kept driving us in circles! Uber refused to take any responsibility, would not offer any discounts and I doubt they even spoke to the driver about his mistakes. Prior to that trip, I waited 10 minutes for an Uber pool just to have it cancel on me, forcing me to request a more expensive Uber X due to time constraints. When I tried to get someone to speak to on the phone, they informed me they don\u2019t even have a phone customer service line! Ridiculous that they are willing to lose their \u201cvalued\u201d customers over only a $14 charge. Spend an extra buck and use a ride service app that won\u2019t screw you over."

No option to do this appeared in the menus until uber had already sent 4 drivers, one after the other, on the route. There is nothing in the help section re how to cancel a trip. There is no way to contact anyone at Uber for help. This is a major problem. Wasn\u2019t there supposed to be access to Uber support after those early incidents where people were attacked by their drivers? It\u2019s nowhere to be found. \n\n2) I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only business traveler to use Uber. Why is there no way to print a simple one-page receipt directly from the app?"

If you\u2019re really trying to improve the app for the driver and the rider than, spend that extra money and get back on google maps. \n\nHowever, I do think uber is an incredible app and a way for every person to be their own entrepreneur, and it always people a safe and clean ride from point A to point B. But their are a lot of apps now doing the same thing, so it\u2019s important to stick with what works and improve what doesn\u2019t.

Uber pool rate, on the other hand, is cheaper\u2014sometimes cheaper than Lyft\u2019s shared ride\u2014because the rider is sharing the ride with other riders and make all riders in a pool rate walk part of the trip! This is not okay with me and even with other riders I talked to who used to be your loyal customers! \n\nThe reason riders request for Uber or Lyft is because riders want convenience. Walking with bags of groceries on rainy days or freezing cold days is not convenient at all! With Uber pool ride rates, riders are required to walk part of the trip. I have no problem walking so long as I don\u2019t have bags of groceries with me and it is not raining or freezing cold! Why call Uber if it let\u2019s you walk halfway anyway?\n\nI\u2019m writing you this so you would somehow make some reasonable adjustments to your pool rates! Please don\u2019t let your riders walk to bring your rates down. Be competitive in a reasonable way!\n\nLastly, I apologize for switching to Lyft!\n\nRespectfully,\n\nJeanette Fabricante\nFormer loyal Uber rider",

If you would prefer not to walk, toggle back to regular Pool to pay a little more for a door-to-door ride. Also, the trip fare and dynamic pricing are subjective to demand and supply in the area at the time. It constantly changes with the rise/fall in either factor.

Half the time their drivers do not arrive at the correct address but yet have smart remarks when they tell you you\u2019re wrong and you point out the correct door number! \nNot to mention their algorithm for wait time to be highly inaccurate. Last night i waited 14 mins (in 27 degrees) for an uber that was originally \u201c5 mins\u201d away.  Bcuz this was a shared ride, he arrived stating he\u2019s at the corner of Hamilton Pkwy and 92nd st- busy intersection. I inform him that I do not see him and request he turn his emergency lights so I can easily identify him in the dark.  What does he do- he hangs up on me. If you are 3-4 cars down, that is not the corner!! Uber needs to have a better vetting system when hiring drivers as these ppl are representing your brand and most (not all) are beyond awful. They give foreigners/minorities a bad name. This company needs a lot of work in the HR department- not cool!!",

I was in two different Uber rides where we got pulled over by the cops. One was because he had unpaid parking tickets and an expired license. So the police took his car.

As a 20 year old who doesn\u2019t drink, waiting around late at night (outside sometimes!) for long periods of time is dangerous.

It was over an hour trip so the conversation about how terrible Uber is went on and on.  I paid him $40 cash to cover the tolls, then I tipped him again on the Uber receipt.  The next day I drove to the airport to pick up my daughter and realized the tolls were a fraction of what was on my receipt.  I was charged tolls going and returning which is fine but the driver complained he would be the one charged for them. Not only that but the tolls added by Uber, both ways, was more than I paid myself using my Mothers car.  I don\u2019t mind the charges by Uber on the receipt.

Depending on where you need to go, the gps navigation in the app never seems to pinpoint certain areas. I\u2019ve had many instances where I\u2019ve called for an uber and on their gps it tells them that they\u2019re at the location but it turns out that they\u2019re still a block away from me. So it makes it difficult, especially if you have to be somewhere at a certain time.\n\nI think a proper background check should be applied for drivers that start with uber. I\u2019ve had many situations where my driver was just downright terrible. Not only terrible at driving, but had nothing to say.. then they expect a 5 star rating. On top of that, they were driving either drunk or were high.  Almost every uber ride I\u2019ve had, I\u2019ve had some sort of refund because of the poor service received.\n\n It makes me nervous every time I ride with uber because of the experiences I\u2019ve had in the past.

I understand that with COVID, there are not many drivers available. That\u2019s not an issue. I\u2019ve seen my way around this and order an Uber 20-30 minutes before I need to. The problem is, that I\u2019ve had over half of my drivers cancel. Most of my rides average about 15 minutes to arrive. I figure I have a few extra minutes to get ready, walk back only to realize it\u2019s on the screen offering me if I want to choose another ride for a higher price. Then again, I guess it\u2019s my fault for not constantly checking to see if a driver decided to cancel. I\u2019ve installed Lyft to see if it\u2019s the same, and while a little more pricey, definitely more reliable. I normally don\u2019t leave reviews like this, but today\u2019s nth cancellation was the final straw. Uninstalling unfortunately.",

As time goes on, Pool passes (possibly even Pool pricing??) gets let and less reasonable to use as a daily tool. What started at 30% higher than standard commute prices is now closer to 130% higher (not factoring the unlimited rides you get on a monthly commuting pass in my city). \nThe new Express Pool is an okay offering to mitigate this expense, however the commuting benefits that partner with Uber can\u2019t apply to these rides.

The driver canceled on their end, but that only prompted another driver. That driver canceled, and it sent yet another. All the drivers were extremely nice and I felt bad for having wasted their time. Finally, practically hidden, we found a tiny \u201ccancel\u201d under a dropdown. Maybe I\u2019m an idiot, but I don\u2019t believe it should be that difficult to cancel a ride. Maybe the obvious \u201ccancel\u201d prompt has worked for others better than it did for me, but I just deleted the app. Too scared to use it and possibly go through a hassle again.",

My thing is ur already online, so Y don\u2019t U conntact me online?! Y is Uber giving out my fone #? That makes me feel violated. How did they get my number, Uber? That makes this app not safe.\n2)Uber needs to either make a way were both users & drivers suggest changes on the map or somehow they make changes themseves. Recently i had a trip were Uber took us to a dead end.\n3) My last 2 trips both drivers had a difficult time understanding the map. The first driver didn\u2019t know where to find me.

But the bad really outweighs the good here as I\u2019ve been done wrong by this app so many times. The most recent one is a flaw in their algorithm that detects the cost of your fare as streets are busy. More importantly the aspect of it that makes the price spike up as it is a holiday weekend or weekday. The price to go to work for me went from $25 to about $50 as it is memorial day weekend. However the problem begins when I noticed there weren\u2019t any cars nor was there any uber within 10 minutes, (i am fine with that because the cost is usually cheaper). But this time it was not cheaper due to this flaw in the system. Only because of the weekend name was there a price boost. They did not think to take it out mid-pandemic.

I think most of the negative reviews were rating their experience with a driver, not the ease of use of the app. You may not be happy with the service, whether Uber or Lyft, but don\u2019t take it out on the app.",

I travel all over the country and found that even though Uber acts like it serves the area where you are requesting service, it frequently just leads you on and cannot provide a ride. DO NOT trust Uber for time-critical events like rides to the airport, without giving 3-4 times as much time as you think you need so that you can find alternative transportation when you get to the pickup screen and discover that you just wasted 20 minutes trying to get a ride that doesn\u2019t exist.

The application has no way to report unprofessional behavior by drivers if they cancel the trip, since you can only comment on drivers in the my trip section. Therefore, drivers who try to cheat do not have any repercussions, or incentive to behave better. This is a major flaw in the app, that leaves it open to abuse.

Try to contact them through the app but the calls don\u2019t go trough so they leave and I get charged a $5 fee over and over again. Uber also tried charging me several dollars more for a \u201cspill\u201d that happened in my car that never happened- at least not while I was in the car. These guys are scammers. \n The point of using something like Uber is to pay less for your ride. Laughable. I\u2019d rather take yellow taxi and save myself the uber hassle of extra charges and late drivers who don\u2019t know how to use gps (but for now I\u2019m using Lyft or Via. Uber? I won\u2019t use it again.) I\u2019ve left a review previously and got a couple \u201cdeveloper response\u201d emails about how the service could be improved. Click the link in the email and guess what- it takes you to their \u201cno customer service\u201d service page. \n\nUseless. \n\nUber please stop contacting me. Im done.\n\nUpdate: Uber contacted me soon after I posted this review and they offered a one time $5 refund. LOL. As if $5 is going to get me as a customer back. Try returning ALL the $5 fees you\u2019ve charged me for your  drivers who don\u2019t show up at the address put into your app and then leave without picking me up then share fees.  No thanks.  No more Uber.",

I can excuse a driver or two not being so so nice because it happens, its whatever. But from DRIVERS, ive been yelled at because THEY cant get to my location (And yes I reported and I was just ignored), argued with, and overall ignored. Aside from rude drivers, Uber will cancel a ride ive been waiting for 10 minutes already, only to replace for another driver that I will have to wait an additional 17 minutes for. On one instance it happened twice. Maybe I am getting bad luck but this is just ridiculous. I have found myself giving too many 1-3 star rating to drivers and it doesnt feel great.

Also, I don't understand how charging a person more than agreed can even be legal?...\n\nAlso, you can wait for a driver for 15 minutes and get a ride cancelled by the driver in the end. I once was late for my job interview because of such a high lever Unter service. Any compensation for your inconveniences? No. And if -you- cancel a driver, who is too far away from you (as you don't want to waste another 15 minutes and get a ride cancelled) - you get a penalty.

Instead, because of \u201ctime\u201d and \u201cdistance\u201d in which the driver decided to take his own route rather than the app navigation I ended up getting charged almost twice what I expected to pay that was listed when I called the car.

What terrible customer service.\n\nIf I can\u2019t rely on them to charge what they say they will and drivers can take whatever route they want and jack up the price I\u2019m not sure why I would want to use uber at all. I\u2019ve contacted them to delete my account. There are just too many other car service, rideshare and other transportation options in NYC to deal with this.\n\nEdit* Glad a developer can actually respond, but all I\u2019ve gotten from Uber so far is their \u201cunderstanding\u201d, but no action. If you want to know what you can do about it then maybe actually take some action about my issue.\n\nEdit #2* Following the developer\u2019s response I went to the website only to be led to the SAME EXACT help options that are in the app. Not helpful in the slightest.

He was so nasty and mean talking to me during the poor conversation he had with me. He kept screaming at me the whole time. \nI feel that he purposely did this to easily earn the $5.00 cancellation charge. This is a very bad way of earning money. \nAfter that I scheduled another ride and the new driver came easily to my location in a few minutes with no delay and he was a very nice and delightful gentleman .\n\nI\u2019m very unhappy and disappointed with the first driver and feel I shouldn\u2019t get the $5.00 cancellation charge because it was the driver\u2019s fault for not doing his job. \nI request to be refunded the $5.00 since it was not my fault because the second driver found me fast and easy\nThank you,\n\nShana Movahedi",

    "review": "This is my second time posting this review because the same issue still remains. Instead of improving it and fixing the problem, Uber sent me an email asking me to please change my review. Sure I will change it, after Uber fixes this safety problem.\n\nI don\u2019t mind a bit walking, I understand that\u2019s the whole point of Express pool, but Express Pool keeps sending me to wait for my driver at freeway exit / entrance, and dropping me off right at the freeway exit. This is incredibly dangerous; I myself have almost been struck by cars a couple of times waiting on the shoulder of the offramp. Someday someone is going to get into a real accident and will 100% sue Uber over it. Rideshare service has always been notoriously bad when it comes to finding a safe legal zone for pickup/dropoff, but this specific scenario is ridiculous. For the sake of  passengers\u2019 and drivers\u2019 safety please fix this! No more stopping at freeway exit/entrance please!",

However now that you guys have added the express pool, I love the thought but it needs to be tweaked. There\u2019s a lot of drivers and riders who do not understand the difference between the two. Many Uber drivers will still drop the express pool person off at their intended drop off point instead of the express route where they walk, and I find it\u2019s unfair when it\u2019s more than half of the price of a regular Uber pool rider. There\u2019s also times when Uber drivers have made me walk to a pickup destination and I never requested the express route, (so they should have picked me up from my actual pickup point). It\u2019s just the line between pool and express is constantly blurred and it\u2019s confusing for anyone who decides to ride Uber pool.",

Drivers are charging cleaning fees for nothing, the GPS is a real mess. They always charge you fees for nothing (for example a Uber driver that makes you wait 15 minutes, lost, that cancels last minute). Always have to contact the customer service and COMPLAIN to get the unfairly charged money back. Express pool and pool services\u2019 prices are important comparing to the service ($14 for 4 miles taking 45 minutes because the GPS keeps changing route and picking up the max people possible). For the last complaint I think this is made on purpose so users are upset and take the uber X service, 3 times more expensive. I don\u2019t know I\u2019m just very disappointed with the company.",

The drivers do not care about the comfort of the customers and sometimes have the windows open to save gas instead of using air conditioning on 80 plus degree days.

Believe me I can afford $5, and from now on Lyft drivers will be the ones who will enjoy my patronage.  Btw- learn how to speak English.",

While making the Uber booking I said I was wearing a fluorescent green long sleeve shirt  At the designated pick up area at the airport a security guard said there is an Uber driver that sees us and said she is our ride\nUber said Danny was our driver. I told the female driver Danny was listed as our driver, She said Daniel and ok!  Half way home she said will need cash.  Knew very little English, very difficult to understand.  I said we do not have the $51 fare in cash. She gave us here cell phone showing her destination.  This was different than ours. She then asked us to type our address in on her phone.  She made several calls to her Spanish Uber contact and said she was going to take us back to the airport.  This was unacceptable for me and I showed he a $20 bill and she pointed to our address and said yes\nWe got home ok.\nMy issue is Uber still has the original $51 charge on our credit card !!!",

I guess a $5 credit off my next ride is what my life is worth to Uber so I will let everyone I know and I myself will never use Uber again.

I waited a minute and looked again, only to see they'd gone up a few dollars. Exhausted and ready to be home, I agreed to the ridiculously high price (which worked out to roughly $3.50/minute) before it got any higher. \n\nTwo minutes after agreeing to the fare, my partner looked up the same route and found it was $105 cheaper now than it had been just a moment before. I was dumbfounded. \n\nWhen my driver picked me up, he made a comment about the drive time being nearly two hours. I looked up the traffic and told him it was more like 45-50 minutes, which it was. He said he'd encountered some glitches with the app and relied mostly on me for directions. The ride was fine. \n\nI emailed back and forth with customer service--never the same person twice--and never received a straight answer as to whether it was normal for prices to fluctuate by $100 in a matter of minutes. The only thing they were clear about was that I agreed to the fare and I should be more careful next time. I don't know if the app was, in fact, suffering glitches or if wild price fluctuations are common, but I felt taken advantage of both as a first time user and as a weary traveler.",

The driver arrival times are rarely, if ever accurate.  On my last trip, the Uber app said approx driver arrival time was 6 mins, then it went to 4, it was over 40 minutes until the driver actually arrived.  Good strategy for Uber, bad for me.  I could have easily grabbed a taxi, and made it home in the amount of time I ended up waiting - for close to the same price.  This situation is becoming more and more common.  And, to make matters worse, UberEats is a disaster.  The food is rarely prepared correctly, often cold, and Uber provides no support whatsoever."

Example , at 6:10a Uber says it will connect you to a driver within 5 minutes, with a predicted pickup at 6:20a and an arrival time of 6:30a and no later than 6:38a.  This is typical behavior.  Unfortunately, also typical is that it doesn\u2019t connect you with a driver for close to 10 minutes and by then the driver is still more than 10 minutes away, or worse they are very close by but 3-4m walk so you have to rush out to not miss them. .

In Manhattan there is a $2.75 surcharge fee and yet a ~17 Minute ride in Manhattan INCLUDING the surcharge fee came up to $13. But in Brooklyn and Queens a 16 minute ride comes up to $25. This has been consistent over months regardless of the traffic. Anywhere you want to travel in Brooklyn and queens and you\u2019re charged more per mile than the city despite the surcharge not applying to those boroughs. Whether you\u2019re going to a minority neighborhood or coming from one, they charge more. \n\nThis is disgusting, you\u2019re better off ordering a taxi cab service.

Yes you read it right. \n5) Uber app is considering your driver arrived even if he\u2019s at 300 meters away and needs to take a u turn or another direction to reach you. \n6) Uber disabled the possibility to write to them through the app. \n7) Uber removed many options in the complaints.

No answer after four texts. Finally, the app updated to say that driver was 8 minutes away. Yeah! But, then the driver cancelled. Really? After waiting over 30 minutes the driver cancelled with no explanation, no text, nothing! So, we were rerouted for a different driver. He was fabulous. But, I think Uber should reimburse me for waiting an hour and having a rude driver that cancelled with NO explanation. That\u2019s crappy service.

Uber care said they would take care of my scheduling probs but they did nothing! It is like Dorthy in the wizard of oz - who\u2019s talking behind that curtain! You all need way better communication skills for when your paying customers need help navigating through your app. Finally, my ride last night that I paid waaay to much for was supposed to be an Uber xl so that my elderly parents and my husband and I could fit comfortably in -  NO it was a miniature mini mini van that my husband - in his suit - had to climb into the back seat and sit sideways so his legs would fit.",

So then I have to reselect my default card and reorder a car. \n\nThis takes seconds but my new price is always a little bit higher. My frustration is high bc I tend to order a car and then not even see the blocker bc I put my phone in my pocket, waiting for the haptic feedback to alert me when I am matched with a driver.

I couldn\u2019t get another Uber because the driver wouldn\u2019t cancel the ride. I ended up having to use a friends account to get a cab. Just ridiculous. I wish Uber had a customer service number.

In my defense i didn\u2019t eat the whole day so it was just a mist of alcohol and stomach acid so it came out like a sneeze.

So my only grievance is, if you\u2019re gonna kick me out, don\u2019t charge me the whole fee as if you brought me home. Stop the meter where I got out.

Either be awesome and give the full discount without a cap or be fully comfortable in your greed and own it and don\u2019t offer it at all. Pick an image you can\u2019t have both.",

He had just had surgery and the first few minutes of my ride I was trying to contact him to see how he was doing. I had never been to his apartment before and after about 10 minutes the driver said oops he was going the wrong way. He corrected but then said he would not charge me for the added time.  However he didn\u2019t know how to do that easily. He was super nice but I feel funny tipping him 15% for a ride that was about $10 extra. Since I\u2019m new and had no idea what else to do I thought I would put it in the ratings. However that takes several extra steps and I think most busy people just blow it off and therefore lose the extra $10 and the time and it does not really affect Uber.",

It\u2019s extremely inconveniencing. For instance, yesterday I had a dentist appointment at 4:30, so I ordered the Uber around 4:06 to ensure that I got picked up in time for my appointment, my Uber had another person he was currently dropping off so I had to wait around 23 minutes which means I WAS PICKED UP AT 4:29, one minute before my appointment, which caused me to be late. And it\u2019s frustrating to say the very least so I firmly believe drivers should only be allowed to pick up people if the customer will only have to wait 10-5 minutes for the driver.

I\u2019ve had for report them many times for driving in a way which made me feel unsafe. This may not seem like such a big deal, but living in Saudi Arabia (where car accidents are the number one cause of early death) it\u2019s a huge issue.\nThe only redeeming factor is that Uber is often cheaper than its competitor in MENA, Careem. However, I will not be using Uber again until driver ratings are damaged because of their ability to cancel on customers who don\u2019t pay cash. Bye bye, Uber! It was nice knowing you."

She is not familiar that on  the katy toll road she can drive in the HOV lane as long as there are two passengers in the vehicle so she would not get charged any toll. This is common place on a lot of houston tolls or simply HOV lanes especially the interstate I10 which goes through houston as these HOV lanes are far less busy. Also when giving instructions to her to turn left or right she is unsure. I am not sure if it is a language issue (she is Hispanic) or just nervous driving.

I said I was not in a hurry and it didn\u2019t matter to me. I said it was up to him. He took E470 to I76. No mention was made about additional fees. After I got home and received the invoice I tipped him and received my total bill. This morning as I looked at emails I see an updated receipt charging me for tolls. \nI object to these additional charges and think you are not transparent and upfront in your fees. I would not have ok\u2019ed going the alternative route if I had know of additional charges. You can be sure I will be reluctant to continue using your services. \nTim Carabello"

I had to redownload as a last resort during the pandemic because there weren\u2019t enough drivers and I needed to make an appointment. \n\nThe actual driver and ride was fine (always pricier than Lyft at least in my experience). However, a month later, the Uber app sends me a notification reminding me to tip my driver. I always do this immediately after the ride so I thought I may have forgotten and I added a tip. I review my receipt and now I\u2019ve tipped twice. I contact Uber\u2019s customer support and they tell me \u201cas a one time courtesy\u201d they would credit the amount in Uber cash. \n\nThey made it sound like they were doing me a huge favor when, in fact, this is their fault. They need to fix the app - customers should not get reminders about completed rides A MONTH LATER. I called this out and they said they couldn\u2019t do anything else. \n\nIt felt like they just scammed me out of money to lure me back into their app. It makes me wonder if they\u2019ve done this to someone else. Also I have experienced Lyft customer service and they are very helpful which made this comparison that much more stark. \n\nUse if you must but beware of their notifications."

Unfortunately, Uber kept double dipping into my debit account which I set up with limited funds and because it kept double dipping (funds hold & charge, instead of releasing the hold), my bank identified it as fraud.  Sucked, now I had to deal with a fraud (not fraud) issue.  Secondly, because of the strike drivers would accept the ride then get to our pick up location... determine whether they wanted to continue (based on traffic) and then cancel the ride.  We literally had 1 driver see us and not stop and cancel the ride at the end of the street, at which point we were charged 6 euros.  \ud83e\udd2c  It took us an hour and 4 drivers before one showed up, by why was I being charged when the driver cancelled the trip (never even stopped to talk to us)."

I take myself off Disney WiFi (which works fine for everything else by the way). Switch to my LTE - pushing 45mbps mind you, it\u2019s not slow or broken. Do the whole process again. Holding a screaming baby mind you. BLANK PAGE. Uber, I have no problem filling out a page to verify my identity but you can shove your broken app right into the gutter. I needed one thing from you, it\u2019s all you do, and you failed miserably. Complete garbage.",

Uber can\u2019t be bothered with the paying customer that has been mistreated and filed a complaint.\n\nThey now have their drivers reporting on you and turning you in if they don\u2019t like the way your face covering covers your face. The driver even threatened me that he would cancel the ride which would have left me beside the rode. I wore a face covering voluntarily like have everywhere but the driver did not like the way it covered my face even though it covered my mouth and nose. My covering dose not go over the nose but covers the openings.\n\n I make regular trips to this specific airport where this occurred  since I am designated essential services by this airport. This covering has been accepted by the airport where the driver picked me up. That doesn\u2019t matter though, if the driver doesn\u2019t LIKE your covering then at the very least you will be reported and worst, like this driver did, threatened that could be stranded.\n\nUber didn\u2019t even post anything to me on their new policies until after this took place. Bad behavior on the part of the driver and the company. They no longer have my business.",

This is the second time THIS MONTH I had to get a new card because my information has been compromised. In total, i have been charged roughly 200 dollars for other people\u2019s trips...The same thing has been happening to my brother, sister, and father who all use uber and have been mysteriously charged for trips in California, Florida... and other far away places (we live in Maryland). The thing is... we all have Lyft and this has never once happened with them.\nSecond of all, Uber is a less safe option. Over 50% of Lyft drivers are female, and in general they have more prestigious background checks for their drivers. Basically, it\u2019s harder to become a Lyft driver than an Uber driver (which is a good thing!). \nThird of all, there is no solid way to contact uber support. They don\u2019t offer a support number, where you could just voice complaints or ask for help. \n\nThis app has been getting on my last nerves and I\u2019m glad to say that I\u2019m finally switching to a safer, more affordable, and secure option.

    "review": "Uber has the most ridiculous system, when it comes to customer service . I tried to update my payment info . I had reloaded my debit card, to pay for a recent fare. And for future fares. I googled Uber support. I went on the app. It\u2019s more geared for the drivers, than the customers! I can\u2019t find a single link, or phone number for assistance! I just want to pay for my fare! Why is it so difficult to get help? On the help link, it states, there are to many customers and fares, to dedicate a help line! Are you kidding me? I have worked for ADP( the worlds largest insurance company , who has hundreds of millions customers ) and New York Life ( who is the worlds largest life insurance company, the too have hundreds of millions customers ) and yet both have help lines! I don\u2019t have a problem with the service of Uber , as far as the rides are concerned, I have a problem, with getting to talk with customer service!"

    "review": "Update: I\u2019m done with Uber. Latest changes on pool have been upsetting. I needed to go a mile and waited five minutes to match with a pool and then got matched with a driver ten minutes away. My prior trip took over an hour when it was a 25 minute drive.\n\nFurther Update: I\u2019m mostly done using it as part of my commute. It\u2019s too often just as slow as public transportation and very often delayed past projections. Additionally, it seems like even when you\u2019re running later than the ETA, they still add new riders to the trip. I\u2019ll continue using it here and there but I\u2019m done with Uber as an integral part of my commute.\n\nUpdate: my driver just made half my trip (out of the way to pick up other drivers) and told me to leave the car saying he wouldn\u2019t drop me off at my destination because it was out of the way of where he wanted to go. However, this is going up to three stars since almost immediately after reporting Uber refunded my trip and even gave me some credit towards my next trip\n\nA few weeks ago my rating would\u2019ve been 5 stars. The last two rides in the last 24 hours have had the Uber get on the wrong highways going in the wrong direction. I didn\u2019t notice until last second so wasn\u2019t able to warn the driver. Hopefully this will be fixed soon"

    "review": "My driver last night could not find me despite the fact that I was in front of a clearly marked, well lighted address. When he finally found it he stopped 10 yards away from me even though I was standing in the street waving my phone. I noted that the car smelled of cigarette smoke. For the rest of our 10 minute ride he proceeded to complain about riders that smoke and bring the the smell into the car (I don\u2019t smoke). But what really makes me angry is that after the ride I got my charge for it which included a fee for waiting time??? Does Uber charge \u201cwaiting time\u201d fees for drivers that can\u2019t find an address? I then spent 30 minutes trying to figure out how to dispute the charge and found there was only this. If you want my business contact me to make this right!!!"

    "review": "Uber has really done a great job with there current app; it is easy to navigate, allows you to see who is picking you up, real time map showing where your Uber driver is while you are waiting, and payment is simple. I would recommend this app for both frequent and infrequent travelers because it is very convenient and simple to use. Typically For every 10 apps I try, only 1 will remain on my phone, this is one that remains on my phone and my family likes it just as much as I do. Normally I don\u2019t fill out reviews but I have had great success with the app and Uber, so I feel confident giving the two thumbs up on this app along with the services."

    "review": "I previously had enjoyed using Uber. Recently took a ride and got into a car that was very messy and dirty. I did not say anything to be polite and the ride was cheep. Two days later I got a fraudulent charge to my credit card from Uber for 30$. The driver charged me with a cleaning fee. Stating I created the mess. No contact was made no email. In trying to resolve this issue there are no phone numbers to call Uber, only email. Their customer service is awful. They do not investigate it and just keep stating the driver reported and there is a charge. If they would review the picture and talk to the driver they would realize there is no way one person could make that much mess in the entire back seat of a car. Either it was already there or the drivers previous ride did it. I am very dissatisfied and disappointed is how Uber is dealing with this."

The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that I don\u2019t like when Uber does a rate surge during/after special events.   I think it causes people to make bad decisions and drive after drinking because the rates can be outrageous and most people cannot afford it.     I understand that the drivers have the \u201cchoice\u201d to up their rates, but to me its unfair business practice and unethical to charge someone 2-6x the normal rate when the rider is at your mercy bc they need a ride.    Once I was stuck downtown and bc of the surge, I paid $250 to get from downtown to 56th & Meridian.    Otherwise, I use Uber frequently & my late husband was an Uber Champion -(over 900 rides)....please please stop doing the surges."

    "review": "Uber, as long as you keep implying that it was your choice to allow users to specify their location tracking options, instead of being forced to by Apple, I\u2019ll keep giving you one star. \n\nTo recap, originally Uber lied about how they would use people\u2019s location information to trick people into allowing Uber to track their location at all times. Uber also deliberately removed the option to allow people to give them location information only while using the app, to force people into giving their location information at all times.\n\nApple had to specifically modify how location tracking worked in iOS 11 to prevent Uber (and other greedy, dishonest companies) from forcing users into allowing Uber to track their location at all times. Uber knew about this upcoming change for MONTHS in advance but chose to keep tracking users\u2019 location (even when they weren\u2019t using the app) until the last moment, when they were forced to stop.\n\nNow Uber is trying to cover up their dishonest, disgusting, and shameful behavior by pretending that it was they who magnanimously decided to give users a choice how their location information is used. That\u2019s just more dishonest, disgusting, and shameful behavior, and it\u2019s hardly the actions of a company that has \u201cturned over a new leaf\u201d."

A few years ago drivers would arrive before the estimated ETA. Now constantly late drivers and drivers that shouldn\u2019t even be on the road are now increasingly the norm. It also is obvious that driver are using multiple apps to make money at the same time because their estimated time of arrival will go up rather than down. In other words drivers are using Lyft to get fares then as they finish rides on the other app they are accepting rides on Uber. So when Uber says 10min it might be 10min or it might be 25min.

Things like changing the destination, sharing your cab status etc take a long time to be processed. A lot of times the estimated fare has also been lower than what is charged at the end of the trip (this is a general problem, I am not ignoring the waiting charges and such). \n\nUber customer care also takes ages to respond and when they do, rarely do they solve your problem, whereas about a year ago they\u2019d respond fast and would be sensitive to the issue you\u2019re facing. I thought these things would be fixed with small updated but instead Uber is busy changing its UI and whatnot. That being said, it is quite convenient and would do better with improving its app.",

    "review": "After being with Uber for a few years I've officially downloaded a new ride sharing app today. During most of the time that I have been with them I have had no problems, but this past year has brought along a surge of issues. I'm not sure if they are not vetting their drivers properly since anyone with a car can be a cab driver now. After dealing with the rudest cab driver that I've ever encountered, I notified Uber only to be sent some generic response. After doing some research on their rating system I was shocked to find out that some of their drivers not only expect to be tipped but demand it for a service that they are already being paid for or else they will rate you lower and it will affect your ability to get future rides. I'm truly disappointed, but love the fact that I live in a city that affords me multiple options, hence the reason why I'm taking my business elsewhere.",

    "review": "I\u2019ve been using Uber for quite sometime now for transportation, primarily to-and-from work. Uber was my go-to choice since it was cheaper than Lyft(at the time) due to their Rewards program offering a discounted price on a set route which is actually really handy!\n\nHowever Uber then came out with Uber Pass which is similar to Lyft\u2019s Lyft Pink in that you pay a flat fee every month to get a discount. I suppose in an effort to incentivize their rewards users to subscribe to this new plan, they got rid of the Set Route Price Protection and replaced it with a much less appealing point boost.\n\nThere\u2019s several problems here. The Uber Pass discount is much smaller than in comparison to the Price Protection discount. I went from paying roughly $25 a day to around $40 just to get to-and-from work. The Uber Pass\u2019 discount is just not incentivizing enough. Its even more expensive than Lyft\u2019s similar service which is $5 cheaper and gives 15% off rides.\n\nThe other issue is that the rewards just are not that good. Realistically, frequent users are going to choose to get a 15% discount on their Uber ride but that still isn\u2019t reliable for frequent riders.\n\nThey either need to revert the Price Protection to its previous state or make Uber Pass more worth it.",

I had to navigate through so many menus denying over and over their assertions that my issue must have been my driver\u2019s fault. After giving me a $5 gift card in an attempt to get me hooked on prepaying for their service, I gave up. I downloaded Lyft and GrubHub as replacements for Uber\u2019s services. WOW the selection of food is SO much better on GrubHub. Lyft drivers seem so much happier, the car got there faster, AND it was cheaper. I\u2019ver never had my opinion change so quickly. Lyft and GrubHubs apps are nicer and less soulless looking. I no longer feel awkward when ordering a car or food with friends who judged me for using Uber. Uber really is as unfriendly and greedy as people say they are. The alternatives are also just better!",

Definitely not worth that just to go to work. Already made other arrangements regarding that. \nBecause my rides are short, drivers tend to not pick me up. Ones that do eventually agree to pick me up eventually cancel wasting more of my time. This is the same for when I make scheduled rides as well. \nMy average experience with Uber is waiting 30-40min just to commute to work. Fortunately, work was empathetic of my situation and gave me no trouble but this is an issue that needs to be resolved immediately. Uber is greedy.\nEdit: \nI also want to add that this price gouging is unacceptable; especially, during these times of a pandemic crisis. It\u2019s understandable that drivers need be payed; however, on the riders\u2019 perspective they can\u2019t afford to pay 4x their usual fare. This driver-rider mutual relationship should be equally treated the same. Quite a contradiction. \nAt the time of this review, Lyft has been reasonable with price and pickup time. I recommend Lyft FORNOW. Hopefully, Lyft learns from Uber\u2019s mistakes.",

Well Uber switched the way they charge you giving you an estimate of 8-12 dollars and more than likely it\u2019ll be the higher cost. They over price their rides. Then canceling rides is a nightmare... they charge you for canceling a ride that may be 10 mins away. Furthermore, their service is garbage and if you write a complaint the customer service is even worst. There are many more complaints that I can make; however, I\u2019ll stop here... as I have great news. Lol I switch to Lyft and they have rides at a quicker and cheaper rate. I also thought previously Lyft sucked because it was an unfair assumption I had made; however, their service is rather prompt, clean and respectful.

What I think happens is if nobody is on and available when setting a schedule the carclock doesn\u2019t show up, nobody to talk to then nobody to schedule with.  Makes sense,  why do I have to investigate this myself?  I was worried the app was broke something stupid.  It was something stupid, the question and answer section is inaccurate and doesn\u2019t answer the question correctly.\nOh and bonus loss of a star is for me having to make up a stupid nickname, that isn\u2019t used already.\nThank you,\nStupidnicknamegamelostyouastar",

The usability app is straightforward. However, I did notice the app tends to lag. I would also like to see the prices be a little more cheaper since riders can have multiple destinations which most likely include round-trips that quickly add up. And that\u2019s not to say the prices are bad or anything like that but it would be more valuable if our dollars could go further while meeting whatever fiscal goals the business model of uber presents.

While there are perks to this service there is also stiff competition in this arena. As such, Uber will have to do better to retain riders. What makes me rate this app or service so low is the poor customer service that I\u2019ve received when presenting an issue with my ride. The agents are fairly passive and dismissive of the concern and offer little to no resolve which isn\u2019t good.

    "review": "Just left Ezekiel\u2019s vehicle at PHL international airport. First of all, I must say that Ezekiel was most courteous and cordial. His driving was outstanding and safe. My negative was the cleanliness of his vehicle. I had to use a disinfectant wipe on the door handle when I discovered how dirty it was. I\u2019m sure my coat is now dirty as well. The other problem was Ezekiel\u2014he had horrible body odor\u2014maybe he wasn\u2019t aware of this. \n\nI have been in some spotless Uber cars and some not so clean, but this was the worst. Is it too much for Uber to require that if you drive for them then your vehicle should be \u201cclean\u201d?  \n\nI don\u2019t want to malign Ezekiel but this was the tip of the iceberg. I do hope that Uber takes the necessary steps to insure that all their drivers take the time to ensure that their passengers are not sitting in a dirty vehicle."

Today, I accidentally open my mail and I check the receipt from my yesterday rode, and I found that they charged me extra for Wait Time! What the heck is that? I was waived my hand to the driver and he (the driver) the one passed me by and he took another U turn and come back again! How the hell that I am the one end up paid for it?!  How about we Waiting Time? Sometimes they said 2 minutes away and I end up waiting for 5 minutes? Uber is getting sucked!! Please don\u2019t be greedy! $0.33 that was not much, but my disappointment is the problem here."

I had a driver tell me Uber purposely ensures customers would not see actual times for airport pick ups to prevent negative customer reactions. No where on this app is there any ability to provide over all feedback on my experience with Uber or even a clear genuine ability to reach out to a customer service rep. I do not have twitter to reach out to the twitter handle provided for feedback nor do I believe tweeting the airport is an effective means for gathering feedback. This was not an issue with my driver but an issue with Uber itself. Since I have no other means of providing feedback I\u2019m writing a review while I wait for my Uber."

We were at the correct pick up point and had been on time and waiting for our Uber driver to connect with us. \nThe pick up location I specified (@2 major Cross streets) was in a very well know  area and at a Major hotel in the city. He was unable to pick us up because he did not KNOW where were!! The Uber driver cancelled our request!! Fortunately a taxi driver was nearby and over heard my conversation on the phone with the Uber Driver. We were able to reach our destination from a very knowledgable and professional person who knew exactly where we needed to go. The price was reasonable as well. \nBut I must say our return pick up Uber driver was exceptional and made the rest\nOf our evening stress free."

However, it is recommended to follow the in-app navigation as it takes into account the traffic, road blocks, etc and suggest the routes. Now, when requesting a Pool, you'll even have the option of Express Pool, where you'll have to take a short walk to and from your ride for a lower price. If you would prefer not to walk, toggle back to regular Pool to pay a little more for a door-to-door ride. For further queries, reach out to us via t.uber.com/contact and we'll connect.",

    "review": "Uber used to be an excellent service. After their latest update their GPS has gotten so much worse. It\u2019s absolutely horrible, I can find a route half as fast through my own google maps, it\u2019s almost as if they try to find a longer route in order to charge you more. Furthermore I don\u2019t mind the walking option, I think it\u2019s great that we get a choice to save money to walk a bit, but if they\u2019re going to offer that then they need to work on the DISTANCE! You can\u2019t have someone walk 13 minutes when the driver they connect you to is only 4 minutes away. That just doesn\u2019t make any sense. It upsets both the driver who cancels half the time and the customer. Fix your programming for that option, unless you purposely do that in order to force us to chose the more expensive option."

The app will charge you before completing the ride so if you Uber doesn\u2019t show up or refused the ride, you have to pay a second time and don\u2019t expect to see your money back for days.

So my driver cancels on me, and I have to pay a $5 fee because Uber can\u2019t get it\u2019s GPS together - on top of me paying 10 or more to get a new ride because I still need to get home. Not to mention it\u2019s not the first time it\u2019s happened. I don\u2019t have a lot of money to waste , so if this continues I\u2019ll probably just go to Lyft."

As soon as she got 2 minutes away she dropped the pickup and they got me another driver that was 10 minutes away as well. Moral is i had to be at work at 5:30 and it\u2019s 5:28 and i still haven\u2019t been picked up . This makes no sense especially when you\u2019re charging people full price. Lyft at least offers discounts every now and then. Uber is so stingy and inconsiderate. Another thing is that there\u2019s no one you can talk to about your concerns.

I was pretty concerned of my safety. Like why is the system so messed up? On top of that, the customer service\u2019s terrible as well.

I particularly invest a big money believing on Uber XL, I bought 8 months ago a brand new suv, I put a lot money on it, so I am frustrated because Uber worries more about quantity than quality. I am in Boston Massachusetts, I don\u2019t know another state. \nIf Uber make a test for about 6 months giving riders first options X and XL, especially at airport, Uber will see  XL growing and drivers and passengers more happy. \nI wish I can do at least about 10 or more good trips  XL per days.\nThanks"
