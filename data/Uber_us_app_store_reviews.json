    "review": "I heard so many good stories about people using Uber and being pleased with its service, but when my wife and I reached Los Angeles and decided to use it I found out the harsh reality. Unfortunately, Uber has become a master of deception using its large user base to suggest confidence, but after getting a quote for a little over 40 dollars, my wife and I ended up getting charged almost 100 dollars because of difference in \u201ctime\u201d and \u201cdistance.\u201d I would be fine if that were the truth, but instead we had a driver that wasn\u2019t focused and missed his exit, then his phone died and we had to use our own phones to guide him. This resulted in us having to drive another 30 minutes just because their own driver didn\u2019t plan ahead or pay attention to the road. I will NEVER use Uber again because the only thing they did to \u201cfix\u201d the problem was give me 5 Uber bucks without any notification and then ignore any requests sent via app to find a proper resolution. So much for customer \u201csupport.\u201d\n                    UPDATE\nAfter a few days of trying to find out how to talk with support staff directly I was able to reach a satisfying solution. I believe the best way to avoid situations like this would be to make the app send a notification when support staff message you, instead of you having to dig and find out where to talk to them. Because of their understanding I may use Uber again, but just be wary about knowing where to contact anyone in case of a bad ride.",

    "review": "If you need a cheap ride and you need to get somewhere then I agree Uber is for that. However they need to fix some issues that keep me from wanting me to. For starters the seller fees are absolutely ridiculous! I should not have to be charged for my drivers errors. I have had numerous occasions of being charged a $5 fee for my driver not being able to find my house. Which brings me to my next problem. \n\nThe GPS navigation they have going is a mess. My old house was a difficult yet not impossible location to find. The u-turn by the gas station was right by the driveway to my house which is easy to miss. However I have tried contacting my Uber drivers giving them guidance. Some still ended up canceling. I have had drivers that would decide it was better to take a longer way for certain places rather than back ways and shortcuts. That also makes everything 10 times  worse, because I have been late to work even scheduled ahead of time since these problems with your system have occurred. \n\nI\u2019m also currently disabled and can\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t drive, because of it. However I can\u2019t blame Uber for being late for work even though it most certainly is. I take my job seriously so apparently I need to go back to Lyft since I haven\u2019t had any of these issues personally. They even found my house in the dark!

What they do is, give you a preset list of 4 or 5 possible issues you may have with a specific ride (so no complaints if 5 drivers in a row cancel right before they are at your location). If you click on the thing from the list they just run your trip through some automated program that determines if you get your money back. My most recent incident my driver took a terrible route, then took two wron turns, adding 30 minutes to what was originally estimated to be a 30 minute trip total, and the navigation app he was using said it would be another 30 minutes. At that point it was literally quicker to walk the last 1 \u00bd miles. So I got out and walked, but it shows up as me having completed the trip, so whether I select driver took poor route or trip was too long, it just spits out an answer based on incomplete information. Clear lack of effort on their part, luckily for me they have competitors that care about the customer experience more then they do.",

Today in the heat I was counting on getting Uber to take my little dog to the vet. They charge extra for the dog which is ok. But the app is now so messed up that I was unable to change the pickup point or my destination. There was no way to do it so I had to drag my puppy in this heat and had great difficulty breathing walking to the vet with a mask on. This is nonsense.  Also it\u2019s screwed up for drivers because they changed the pop up I used to see after the ride. Now I have to go to past trips up in the left corner to search for the trip and then add the tip. I was totally unable to select 5 stars for the driver. How many people are going to bother to do all this when it\u2019s money they could save. This is one more proof of how Uber has little regard for their riders or drivers.   To all apps:  Stop filling in the blanks with what you think I want to do or where I want to go. You are creating a mess and proving we have nothing to worry about from artificial intelligence yet.   The app worked months ago but stop making it so smart that it\u2019s unusable.",

    "review": "When deciding wether to use Uber, Lyft or take a taxi, I need accurate pickup times. Increasingly, they are wrong and seem to be a bait and switch. Routinely, the app says, for example, it will take 3 minutes to be picked up so, i request ride. But as soon as a driver confirms pickup, the time until pickup becomes a lot longer. And regardless of the pickup time listed, 9 of 10 times it takes considerably longer for the driver to arrive. I can\u2019t tell If this is an app or driver problem or both.  Regarding the app, it looks to me like bait and switch. Get me to select a ride with short pickup time, and suddenly after selecting the ride double it or more. And even the extended time is wrong and the driver takes longer to arrive. This problem continues to worsen.  I also now sometimes see drivers not responding to rides, at least on the app. On the driver location, I\u2019ll see a driver sit without moving for minutes before coming to get me. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a problem with the app or the driver accepting a ride and taking his to time before coming to get me. This happened at an airport pickup last night again. I walked past the cabs because it showed a 3 minute pickup time But actial pickup was 10 min and i could have practically been home already in the taxi. For the first 5 min the driver sat where he was when he accpeted to ride. I need reliability.",

I am not happy with UBER trying several times to direct me to another pickup point in the pouring rain. Why did UBER expect me to got to a more \"convenient pick up point\" which was only more convenient for the driver, not the passenger. Not a good thing to make me waste my time with such foolishness. The UBER drivers are getting paid for picking up a passenger wherever he or she is currently located and taking them to wherever it is they need to go.  If UBER was trying to make improvements to their service this is \"NOT\" the way to do that in my opinion, just saying.",

I didn\u2019t have to wait long and I received a text when my ride was a minute away. By the time walked outside the driver was pulling up.

    "review": "The driver's app must be broken as uber seems to feel the need to call the rider and ask them where they are and where they're going. Perhaps, the drivers aren't able to see what the customer has typed, the map, the address, gps, the live blue dot and the live symbolic car that represents the car that the uber driver is driving. Those all must be buggy as well.  Maybe, the maps are incorrect, too? The drivers can't seem to use gps and a live location from the passenger (blue dot) to find where they're going or where the passenger is waiting. \nRating system has problems as well. Star ratings can't be used to choose a driver. If the driver accepts and he or she has a low rating, you can cancel, but expect to pay the penalty fee. Driver's cancel all the time, but are not charged a fee. Perhaps a system error is to blame as no one would chose an arbitrary rating system except an old tv show where the points don't matter. \nFinal app issue: wait times. When the app says, five minutes away, it really means 12-15 minutes away. You can cancel, but your credit card will be charged each and every time unless you dispute the charge. Maybe, it's supposed to be like that? Seems counterintuitive, and unlike a similar app that doesn't have incorrect wait times, penalties for customers and an arbitrary rating system where the points don't matter.

There have been a lot of updates to traffic patterns in NYC in the last 6 months and I don\u2019t think uber gps has been updated with these. (Example: no left turn allowed onto 8th Avenue going east on 14th street - this is my typical pickup location and the driver usually has to spend 5 minutes driving around the block unless I text him to meet me elsewear). The other problem which is a recent one that has happened the past 2 days is that I get matched with a very convenient driver, walk to the pickup location very happily and then they cancel. The next drivers (multiple) I am matched with are extremely far away (up to 10 minutes) and I am forced to cancel and get into a yellow cab because I am now late.  Drivers should not be able to cancel when they are that close to picking up their rider, especially with uber pool where that person has most likely walked decently far to get there.",

It involves meeting your Uber at a determined location, this is very good and an excellent way to mainstream the process and make it more efficient.\nBut unfortunately the AI in control of matching the rider with the Uber seems to be based on distance away from the rider instead of actual logistics.\nThis is a problem for me since my pickup spots are always near an highway/expressway on street level (BQE in NYC) and the Ubers that are matched to me are always traveling on said expressway instead of on the side streets. Because of this, I've been matched with multiple Ubers that are traveling on the expressway and who's nearest exit is 30 minutes away. Due to this fact I couldn't even cancel the Uber since I would be charged a 5 dollar fee for due to the driver having to drive past me. \nThis leaves me with 3 options either take the 5 dollar fee and call another Uber or to call the driver and ask them to cancel the pick-up. Wait an extra half-hour for an uber. The 2nd option is often met with hostility with some drivers, and the 3rd option is just not feasible due to the driver having to drive back and then drop you off adding an extra hour to the commute. \nPlease take a look at this problem as it is extremely frustrating to book an Uber only to be late and frustrated at the process.",

This morning alone I had to cancel 3 trips because they were more than 7 minutes away and by the 4th request an Uber was just 2minutes away. Why couldnt I get matched with the closest uber first?? Then my next problem and probably the worst is the Uber\u2019s navigation. One example was a trip i took from the bronx to Yonkers and the navigation led the Uber all the way downtown to 138th street to then loop us around to go uptown to 231st. How? When I could look at the GPS and find several other routes that were quicker and less of a hassle. And finally, i want to mention that i dont even use the pool option anymore because it feels like taking the bus. I sat in a pool once and before I got to my stop we picked up and dropped off 4 other people. I wouldnt have minded if it was on the way to my destination but it was so out of the way I considered getting out and taking the bus.

I really wish Uber would give you the option of seeing miles instead of kilometers, and also American dollars currency. I would have used Uber sooo much more it having that option to change in settings. For example, I used it today in Mexico. I wanted to go to a certain store. I put it in the Uber app, and it showed around $40, I thought it must be really far. Looking at the map, it showed kilometers. Then I noticed it was showing the cost in pesos. I had no idea how far it really was, or what it would charge me in American currency. SUCH A PAIN. The ride ended up being not so far, and only around $3 American. Then the top popped up, I clicked on $5 thinking it was a couple of dollars. Later my daughter figures it out and tells me that the $5 only ended being like twenty four cents. I felt so bad. UBER really needs to make a setting that you can choose what you want your miles/kilometers and currency to show. I seriously would be using it more here in Mexico, but too difficult because I can\u2019t see what it\u2019s really going to cost me, and clueless on how far of a distance it is.",

Not to mention the fees keep going higher and higher. Uber is getting worse than taxis. At least with taxis I don\u2019t have to walk unreasonably long distance and wait for the driver. One more thing, Atlanta airport installed heating lamps in the Uber pick up area, which is the most idiotic thing to do in 90 degree weather. \n\nFurthermore, more and more Uber drivers install obnoxious air refresheners that are overwhelming and headaches inducing. Can Uber develop air refreshener policy. Because if I cancel the ride based on smelly car then Uber will charge me cancellation fee - not fair. Taxis don\u2019t do that. If I don\u2019t like the quality of taxi then I don\u2019t get in without paying fees.",

    "review": "I would like to address the false advertising on the Uber app for pricing. I understand that when ordering an uber that the timing is what determines the price, however, for the scheduling an uber option, there should be more clarification on how much the price can range. Giving a price range that only shows a 7 dollar price difference does not encapsulate how much the uber can actually be. Also, not only that, but when you schedule an uber, you are not allowed to see the actual price of the ride until AFTER you take it. If I schedule an uber that ranges from $13-$17, I expect the ride to be around that price then, maybe even a little higher, but not much more than that. There should be an option to see the actual price when the driver is on his or her way because if it is going to be too expensive, I would rather cancel it and pay the cancellation fee than pay an absurd fare. If I schedule an uber some time in advance, I should realistically be able to see the price of it when the driver is on the way so it is fair. It is not ethical to have the app designed this way with no way of seeing the real fare of a scheduled uber before taking it. I have not had any other issues with this service except for the lack of this quintessential feature. Also I won\u2019t mention the lack of customer support... I can\u2019t even email Uber a complaint.",

I understand there is a wait time charge if the Uber driver arrives and they are obviously kept waiting but recently quite often the Uber driver can be at the corner of my block stating it arrives soon and I\u2019m waiting outside and at the end of my trip I see there is a charge for wait time. How can that be if I was ready and they weren\u2019t even in front of the pick up location. Or I\u2019ve have a few times where the driver states it\u2019s here but they aren\u2019t at the correct pick up even though I put the address and they are a few buildings away and then I have to walk to them and that causes them to start charging a wait time fee. Not sure if that is their GPS issue but it\u2019s annoying. Just the other day I requested an Uber and I was outside and the driver instead of heading straight which is where I was he drove around the block before arriving to me and then headed my way, mind you there was no traffic or others cars there for him giving him reason to go around the block. And what do you know I was charged a wait time fee. This is very frustrating and I have reached out to support which they have helped but it\u2019s annoying to constantly be going thru support. I hate to be that type of person that always has a complaint but they need to address this issue .",

Leaving me not being able to rate that driver & let him know what an inconvenience he has caused me. Also, normally you would be able to cancel your ride free of charge if your driver was more than 5 minutes away, today my driver was 13 minutes away, I cancelled because I was in too much of a hurry & was still charged $5. I'm extremely OVER this app, I will begin to use my local TLC driver companies from now on since they so conveniently make you comfortable ordering their vehicles and they actually give you real life people experiences even when you\u2019ve been inconvenienced. I also have had drivers lie about their vehicles that they\u2019ve been traveling in but because the license plate matched then I had to ride in that vehicle. Reaching out to Uber has become a joke because they purposefully make you feel like you\u2019re the problem and their well within their means to do and have drivers do as they please. The support at Uber has become nonexistent and they\u2019re prices have increased so dramatically that I should basically buy my own vehicle and pay my own gas and insurance, it would be so much cheaper.

However, I see all sorts of issues with the way the app works.  I\u2019d love to be able to provide this feedback to them in the app and help them improve and avoid several situations where they\u2019ve been unintentionally making it more difficult to use.   There is no way to contact Uber to let them know these things.  As a result there have been issues that have existed for years and create annoyance on a weekly basis.  This is not the type of customer centric experience I\u2019d expect.   One of many examples.  When booking a ride to the Atlanta airport, the app only displays the first characters.  These are Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson... then it gets cut off before being able to select the only information that really matters - which terminal?  As a result, ever ride defaults to the international terminal.  Every passenger and every driver I\u2019ve talked with about this has experienced the same problem.  I\u2019m sure this happens thousands of times a day.   Probably worth the minute it would take to fix this.  This App Store feedback is the only way I\u2019ve found to actually communicate this to Uber.  That\u2019s just scratching the surface.

I wrote them three times to ask what was going on and why I was being investigated, but I never heard back from them and usually they are very quick at responding to emails. I just think this is very unprofessional on their part as they should be able to give the reasons why they decide to put my account on hold. But it\u2019s not fair on my end because I might be accused of something I did not do at all because I use UberPool most of the time.

Sometimes it gives you the option to pay almost $2 more to get a door-to-door service which makes it about the same price of getting an UberX so it loses the purpose of booking a Pool. I remember when you just initiated the new UberPool system, you told customers that it will decrease prices. What we actually got is the same prices for having to walk to get an UberPool which doesn\u2019t bring you on time to where you need to get. Driver arrival times are misleading, destination arrival times are misleading, and us customers just keep cooperating with inflating prices while the service we actually get is worse. It would be more fair if at least we customers could now upfront that we get worse service and have the option of reaching a better decision whether we should call an UberX or a Pool. If the ETA of the driver is said to be 9 min, it cannot arrive in 20min (assuming he didn\u2019t have any unexpected obstacles in his route) and if the ETA to your destination on a Pool is a window of 20min but it actually takes 40min to get to your destination, you should notify the rider upfront on the actual time window of arrival so he can reach a smart decision whether he wants to use the service or not. \nWe want the old UberPool back and we want honest ETAs.",

    "review": "Uber is not a bad service, but I think the rating system needs to be done away with, or at least used more judiciously, for a number of reasons. The judgement of the drivers (as well as the quality of their service) can sometimes be hit or miss. For example, I had a driver yell at me for asking him to lower the radio. Nine times out of ten co-riders couldn't care less so I figured it was ok to ask him. After passive-aggressively avoiding my request this guy goes on a tirade on how he leaves it on for the customers and how it's his therapy or something like that. \n\nIt's frustrating for me to see my rating go down on account of driver's who report anonymously. If my performance as a passenger really was such a big deal, drivers can just report me and take it up with management, but as it stands, there is no clear criteria as to what constitutes good \"5 star\" conduct. I do my utmost to be on time, courteous, and forgiving towards drivers who give less than a professional performance. The fact that there are drivers out there who can't reciprocate and who go out of their way to rate me lower just goes to show, as far as my judgement is concerned, that the drivers on this app need to be held more accountable to their customers and their employers.",

Not anymore. They moved the pickup area!!!!  It was raining and cold. I had gone to the original pickup sight to catch my ride. The pickup area had changed. Now I\u2019m running with my bags and other things in the cold and rain trying to get to the new spot. I\u2019m letting the driver know I wasn\u2019t aware the location had changed and I was on my way to the new location and would arrive very shortly. I received a notification my driver had cancelled my ride. I got to the new location right after receiving the notice. VERY UPSET, TIRED AND WET. He chose to cancel me and pickup someone already there. Well here\u2019s the devastation. I had to request another driver to get home. So now I\u2019m paying the actual driver who took me home and discovered I\u2019m paying the driver who cancelled me as well.  TWO CHARGES. That\u2019s ridiculous when I was Minutes away. As for the driver it is easy to pickup someone standing there knowing you\u2019re going to get compensated for both. A charge from me plus a charge plus tip from the driver you pickup. Not happy with Uber. Will look into LYFT\u2019s customer service rules and driver ethics. If you didn\u2019t know this now you do. Uber can cancel a customer, charge a fee for the driver and leave you having to start the process over again and pay again.",

The second time traveling in Brisbane Australia from a residence to the Brisbane Transit Center in downtown Brisbane. Uber worked great. Five stars for this ride to the public transportation center of the city. \nWhen we arrived back at the Brisbane Transit Center three day later and needing a ride to the residence, we again contacted Uber. We described where were, under a very large sign stating Brisbane Transportation Center including it\u2019s street address. We got a text from our driver to verify location, and we agin texted our location, address, and location under the very large sign at the entrance to the transit center. Three days earlier we had been dropped off about 30 meters from where we stood on the same side of the same street by the first Uber driver. The potential driver responded with a thumbs up. The app indicated he was less than a minute away. He called a moment later and my wife again explained to the driver our location. My wife said he was difficult to understand. After about 15 minutes of waiting we got the Uber cancellation notice. We called someone else (not Uber) who spoke English and new exactly where we were. Five stars to someone besides Uber.",

    "review": "As a driver for uber, i constantly hear from passengers how difficult it is to see what kind of vehicle is picking them up. I have used the passenger app myself and i can attest to the fact that the color and picture of the vehicle along with the license plate are so miniaturized that they are difficult to see. Not to mention people with visual disabilities and color blindness will find it even harder to know what color car is picking them up. I\u2019ve had new users show me the app and i have had to explain to them how to navigate and see the driver\u2019s details including type and color of the car. From a passenger\u2019s stand point, it would be most helpful the screen is divided into rows; right side for the map and left side for the name, vehicle type, color and license plate or vice versa in block letters for easy visibility. Also it needs to say what color instead of showing the color. For passenger\u2019s whose phone battery is running low while they wait for the driver to show up, the constant use of location service which is a battery killer should be changed to maybe every 1 minute for example if the driver is 7 minutes away from being constant. This will help the passenger as well as the driver as it will post the most accurate and recently updated location.",

Uber informed me that the ride was 2 minutes away, but after waiting 10 minutes, the app had only gone up 6 minutes to a total of 8 minutes away. This compelled me to contact the driver, who was extraordinarily rude. This uber was extraordinarily unprofessional, had more than one of her own friends in the car, and talked to me in a condescending way when asking if she was alright and would prefer for me to find another ride. She then continued to drive away and lengthen the time of pickup after responding to me \u201cwe good you\u2019ll be straight\u201d after asking if she was okay and whether she\u2019d prefer me to calm another ride. Because of the unfriendly system of the uber app, I was never able to contact the company in order to report the driver, while it was a major annoyance for me, it wasn\u2019t the end of the world. But I want to report this driver for being unprofessional and Uber does not give the opportunity to do that, the app does not support the customers or even try to. Use lift whenever you can.",

They only decided to charge me this after the ride had completed. \nI tried contacting customer support and its no use. There is no number to call to get their \u201c24/7\u201d live calls with someone from customer support either. I looked it up through google and it was just an automated message that hung up.

I did get to send a message through the app asking why was my total changed or updated. I only got an automated response that was no use. \nTotally disappointed and feel cheated.

However, the maybe five times I have used to I have encountered several drivers who just don\u2019t seem capable of doing the job and the customer service always seems to want to place blame on your somehow. A few incidents I recall quite well was one where a driver drove past my location and to the destination without ever picking me up and then reported the job as completed. Another when the driver cancelled the drive mid route when he hit traffic , and then the support teams response was \u201c If a trip is cancelled for any reason you still must pay the cancellation fee\u201d and after that debacle and arguing they eventually refunded me, and lastly was when I had a flat and parked and ordered an Uber to come pick me up - my driver only spoke Spanish and was driving around my location but not getting to it. I sent her a description of my location to help which she presumably could not read because she responded \u201cI\u2019m here\u201d in Spanish after opening the messages and being no where near the mapped location. Then I responded to her the same description but in Spanish ,which she read, and then promptly cancelled the ride. Then I had to fight with customer service for a full refund.

The first time the gift card paid for my half and the second time the gift card should have paid for my half and then another payment method cover the remainder. On the second ride, my sister (who had also received a $20 gift card) was able to use what was left of her gift card balance and her backup payment method was charged the remainder. My backup method paid the entire trip and my gift card balance was not used. When I submitted a request for Uber to look into this, I was told that you have to purchase more Uber cash to use the remainder of the gift card. This would not be a big deal if my sister - who in the exact same situation - would have had to have purchased Uber cash to use hers. Obviously this is a lie since it worked for her. I was then told that due to my issue my gift card balance would be refunded to me and to provide a mailing address. After a month had passed I followed up on this and was told that I cannot get a refund for my gift card and the prior employee had lied. Now, I am being told the same story that you have to purchase Uber cash to use a partial gift card which is back to the same lie I was told in the beginning and can prove wrong based on my sister\u2019s half of our shared receipt.

The Uber app itself was very easy to use, the fares were very reasonable and the drivers were very friendly and understanding (for the most part). Unfortunately, although Uber was my go to ridesharing app, there became a time when I was charged a different amount for a trip in which I had paid the amount fully beforehand (the fare was shown and I agreed to pay with my personal debit card). I was shown a price upfront of $7 and later I received a notification from my bank that I was charged $33 from Uber in which I was very confused and a bit fustrated. I tried reaching out to Uber Support upon their app, but it was a painful experience. The messaging system itself is automated so I received the same response over and over without much help. It asked me to pay the \u201cOutstanding Balance\u201d on my account in which I did, first using a relatives card and later my girlfriends. Yet even then, my account still read \u201coutstanding balance\u201d and BOTH my girlfriend and relative were charged the $30 with my account still being blocked. I then decided to simply delete the app but Uber did not allow me to delete it. I now cannot use the Uber app and I am completely blocked away.

As a single woman hoping into stranger\u2019s cars, I like being able to confirm that I\u2019m riding with the right person before entering their car.

    "review": "I love the idea of ride share like Uber or Lyft. Sometimes it\u2019s way more affordable than cabs. However, I have not had a good experience with Uber. Over two years ago I was in NYC and was waiting for the driver forever who never came so I had to cancel the ride and wait for another driver. Got charged some fees which after some digging for customer service (since they make it so inaccessible) I was refunded in the form of store credit. Well years go by I try to log in to my account and it asks me for the first six digits of my card and there is no way to overcome that step to log in. My card expired years ago! Was I supposed to hold on to it? Anyway, now I\u2019m unable to log in to my account and when i send the message to them it asks me to verify my email by clicking on the link sent to my email otherwise they won\u2019t process my request. Cool. Well when I click on the link the server is down so I cannot verify my email so my messages to support aren\u2019t going through. I cannot log in to my account or create a new one because it is the same phone number and there is no phone number  to contact them. Thank god there is Lyft. Even though it is a little pricier than Uber, I guess you get what you paid for. Honestly, Uber was cool when it was the only app , now there are so many alternatives so if I were you , go with a better alternative. Uber went downhill :/",

    "review": "I feel that Uber should change the age limit for Ubers. Some parents send their children in Uber/lyfts because they do not have transportation. By changing the age limit to ride in a Uber causes kids to NOT have any transportation and to not be safe outside in the cold without a ride/walking in the dark. You are also putting their lives in danger because the ride was already ordered and they have no way to get home. Uber DOES show the location on where you are at anytime. Uber DOES show how to share your location as WELL AS A SAFETY MODE. Uber does all these things for adults why can\u2019t they do it for children(teenagers) too? They are still making more money AND WHEN YOU REFUSE THE RIDE YOU CHARGE $5.00. If you are going to charge $5 as a cancellation fee you might as well just allow them to ride. It\u2019s also wasting time when the Uber driver IS ALREADY THERE then refuses the ride due to being a minor. I don\u2019t think children should be allowed to make an account but be able to get in a ride to get home. I\u2019m not saying \u201cdon\u2019t take Uber\u201d but I feel that some of their rules are unfair. \u201cWe will Uber to your place. Be right there.\u201d Yeah you\u2019re right there but you\u2019re refusing me a ride home. I don\u2019t think anyone under 10 should be getting in the car with a stranger but TEENAGERS.

Are you friken kidding me I\u2019ve already lost 16 minutes and they charge me a $5 cancellation fee when I didn\u2019t cancel anything !

Why make it more difficult for users? It\u2019s even worse when the app glitches. From did the driver even start the ride to I had to cancel the trip just for it to end the actual trip. Then the times where the app wasn\u2019t working at all. Period. Oh, don\u2019t let me forget about the drivers I\u2019ve gotten as well.

I\u2019ve been harassed and money stolen off of trips and have reported it NUMEROUS TIMES,  but that seems to not get me anywhere. 2 stars. Financially crippling for those who have to take uber, but no longer can afford it for work. Awful customer service, especially when you need to get things done, response time is the worst.

Our driver was choosing and switching music on his iPad while he was driving. This ride cost over $23 for myself only. There were 6 other people in the car. The driver had the audacity to ask for a 5 star rating. Once I told him he did not earn a 5 star rating, he low-balled me! Now my overall uber rating is a 4.8! However, 4.8 and still can\u2019t get customer service. I did email with Karen and Sara, so you know who to avoid in customer service.\n\nContacted uber support, as always, they did not do anything to solve the issue or follow their own standards and give me a refund. If the arrival time is over 5 minutes of the estimated time, their policy is to issue you a refund. They never do. \n\nI have heard rumors that people receive their refunds quickly, or get great customer service, but those rumors are false. Through research, no one I\u2019ve even met had received even mediocre customer service. The great reviews online and in the store are actually paid or otherwise enhanced with perks and such.",

    "review": "I want to say that I have only had one major issue with Uber as a rider and I personally like Uber. However, I still think you need to improve the service. First, the location feature for the rider is subpar to me. I use Uber a lot to drive my to college and I have to put in a specific address just to have my drive take me to the part of the school I need the drive drop me off. It would be a lot easier to have a satellite view of the map give the drive an exact location of my destination. Second ,you are now starting to charge all these ludicrous fees such as the waiting fee if my driver has to wait more than two minutes at my pickup location. I understand that having to make the driver wait on me when I sometimes have to get ready when I should have done that before the driver arrived at my location is rude, but Lyft doesn't charge me a waiting fee. Third, I do not like the rating system. The idea that giving anything less than five starts automatically assumes that the driver did something wrong. If I give a driver a four star rating you assume that the driver must have done something. When I give a driver a four star rating I am telling the driver that I enjoyed the drive. I do not imply that I had a horrible experience with an Uber rider.",

Having used Uber many times before, I assumed it was a fluke and contacted Uber and received a full refund. However, this happened again today! This time I knew better and canceled my ride, right when I got the notification that I was on my way when I was still waiting on the curb. I got charged a cancellation fee, because I canceled mid trip. I tried calling the driver multiple times to no success, and was forced to contact Uber AGAIN. \n\nWhile Uber\u2019s costumer service has been satisfying in the way that I have gotten my money back, the amount of time I have wasted these past few weeks has been irritating to say the least. I have spent at least an hour waiting for Ubers that weren\u2019t coming, and trying time and time again to call another Uber. I have been late to several events because of this, and have been forced to use Uber x instead of Uber pool because my pools have canceled on me or taken the wrong person.

If you wanna go 10 min down the road it is $20-$34.

I used to pay $8-$12 sometimes $15 just to go from my house to work and now I can\u2019t even afford to go to work. It isn\u2019t that helpful. While I understand the drivers need to get paid, the more expensive you create ur prices the more you will lose customers because nobody can afford to pay that much 5 days out of a week just to go to a job to support themselves. I literally sit on the app for 3 hours hoping the prices will decrease and change but they don\u2019t they just get higher and higher every time I open the app. I can\u2019t keep riding with a company that wants to charge me $30 every time I need to go 10 min down the street for a job to create a living. It is not affordable and is stressful when you can\u2019t get a ride when you absolutely need one.

NO ONE, no matter how good their driving skills, should be driving passengers without enough English to communicate if the trip is longer than 15 minutes! LAX was 50 minutes away. It required highway and exits. What if there was traffic jam, an emergency or I wanted to reroute for any reason? I certainly would NOT have allowed my daughter or son to ride with someone who could not communicate.\n\nI understand giving people a chance to make a living.

I was walking towards my pick up location while on the phone w/ the uber driver (Jesus), he hung up on me & cancelled my ride. I requested an uber for the second time & he was the driver again. I called an abundance of times which I have the records of my call history to prove that,  he stopped answering for me. I called again & he answered stating that he was parked 2 blocks over at the \"pickup location\". I asked if we could stay on the phone so that I can meet him; w/ frustration in his voice he agreed. I walked in the area he stated that he was in, he was not there. I told him a landmark of mine & he drove over immediately! In less than 1 minute! The moral is, I was charged a cancellation fee along w/ cancelling & I never cancelled my ride. I would like my money back as well as would like to report this driver. I was traveling w/ minimal funds, it'll be nice for uber to have an \"oops we charged you\" here's a free corteous ride due to UBER mistake! I had no $ to get another uber & used my last on a ride I never took!",

    "review": "We arrived in Fort Lauderdale on a evening flight and after picking up our bags submitted our request for UBER.  I put in the address of 555 NW 62 St Fort Lauderdale as that was the of the Hotel we had reservations (Sheraton Suites Fort Lauderdale) I got a message saying I needed to move to the ride sharing area at the airport.  Saturday night at this airport was extremely hectic with dozens and dozens trying to use UBER. During this time my back back with laptop and many other valuables was stolen.  A witness reported he seen the guy take it and re-enter the airport.  I went in and reported my loss to airport security.  Returning I got a message that my ride had expired and would have to resubmit request.  I did and another Uber driver was on his was.   I asked him if he had the address 555 NW 62nd St and he said he did.  I then said that it was a Sheraton Hotel and was not far away.  He said ok.  After a few minutes we asked again although his English was pretty much non existent he said yes 555.  Shortly we found out we were on our way to Miami.  He then let us out at Wendy\u2019s way south of Fort Lauderdale and said I would have to \u201crequest a new driver sorry\u201d. So then we got another Uber that delivered us to the right address.  If the driver spoke English the situation would have been resolved earlier.  Our first experience with Uber was not a good one costing us over $60 to go just a few miles.",

    "review": "Uber was working great for me but as of the last week or so, it has been terrible. I keep trying to request a ride and then a driver is found for me but the driver never comes. I had to cancel like 3 rides, two I was charged for. I literally can\u2019t request a ride with Uber anymore. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on with this app but something needs to be fixed. I use to love Uber, I use them very often for work and personal. I got a credit for my fees I was charged for a cancelled ride and was issued a credit. BUT I STILL CANNOT USE THE APP AND REQUEST A RIDE TO EVEN USE THE CREDIT. He navigation is always off. Drivers asking me where to go, or the navigation just goes way out of the way making a 15 minute trip into a 30 min. It\u2019s ridiculous. I really want to continue using Uber but I can\u2019t keep getting cancellation charges for something that is Uber\u2019s fault. I requested an Uber and it showed that the driver was on the way. It said he was literally a minute away. I called the driver 3 times and I got no response so I cancelled the ride. And I got charged. Same thing happened twice. I\u2019m very disappointed. I hope Uber can make it worth the customers while to persuade them to stay. Because the competitors are looking good right now. They are a tab bit more expensive but at least the competitor is reliable. That is more than I can say for Uber as of late.",

That being said, I\u2019m on first name basis with nearly all the drivers in my area. However, there are some bad apples out there. My main dislike is when drivers don\u2019t end the trip. I work at an airport, and I\u2019ve had drivers take me home and go all the way back without ending the ride until they get there. This results in a ~$25 trip costing $50+. Of course, this makes me have to go open a help ticket with support. (They made this harder to do it seems). Another trick of some drivers is to get close enough to start the ride, then if they don\u2019t like it, they\u2019ll either cancel it, or drive away somewhere far enough where I\u2019ll have to cancel it. On my dollar. What\u2019s more, if the support team see you have a \u2018pattern\u2019 of requesting a refund, they can deny you one. Even if it\u2019s clear it\u2019s an error on part of the driver. \nI feel like the driver\u2019s app should have a fail safe built in. If they make it to the drop off location, and leave farther than a certain distance, the trip should automatically end. God forbid I\u2019m busy when I make it home or to work and can\u2019t check if the driver still has the trip up. Sheesh",

Then I get an email requesting a screenshot of my own phone number in my contacts list. Done. Waiting for the next email requesting additional info...all the while my acct is possibly hacked and could be used by someone if that is the case. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT at this point!  Going on Day2. They managed to finally reset my account and allow me to login in to the website but the app still does not work.

    "review": "I use this service at least once a day. Over the last couple days though I\u2019ve had horrible drivers that I\u2019ve had to contact Uber about. I give them credit though bc when I write them they get back immediately and they at least try to rectify the issue. With a small credit or something. What I dislike is that a driver will accept ur ride but then take 5-10 mins to leave their house. Other times they are on the road and arrive in a timely manner. I had one driver refuse to let me stop at a fast food restaurant. I had another that missed the turn and ended up costing me an extra $7 for a trip I take frequently. And actually the day that happened I sent my friend a text sharing my location because we were lost, he ended the trip, and I had no clue where we were. I feared the worse. Anyway that\u2019s my rant. I still \u2764\ufe0f Uber and will continue to use them. The great thing is that if you rate a driver poorly, Uber won\u2019t match u with them again. The bad part is, u have to add all stops BEFORE ur trip. It\u2019s not like Lyft where u can add a stop while ur already in the car.",

    "review": "Highly useful application. Very versatile and makes it surprisingly easy to find a ride. The different types of Uber rides are easy to select and they can be found quickly using the touch screen interface. The map is highly accurate and displays in real time where the driver is located so you can monitor your progress both too and from your destination. The trip is also tracked via time giving you an accurate estimate of the time between destinations. The driver can contact you and leave a message when they arrive so you do not have to keep them waiting. Finally, once the ride is complete you can rate them and leave a tip easily. The Uber drivers are always friendly and helpful when you get into the car. It helps to be prepared and alert for the trip just in case there are multiple routes to your destination of traffic delays. Truthfully, the app is a very convenient way of getting around and I use it frequently. I would recommend this application to anyone who needs a fast and accurately trackable way of getting from destination to destination.",

I kept getting error messages to try back again, I did , over 9 times. So , no was was established to pay for a ride if I needed one. This was despite the fact the Uber easily loaded all of my payment methods. The Uber would not allow sign in on my cell, despite 3 hours of being online via cell & laptop. Uber would not allow my sign on via cell, as it presented error message after error message stated that an error had occurred with the cell number. 4 hours trying to get Uber to work, tried deleting my account, Uber states that the account has been deleted, but it is still there via laptop sign on .

(With note to use cash for any additional tip!). Too late- driver was gone!!  Why this change since I last used app 2 days ago?? I wanted to give a larger tip, so left $ 10 and logged out. Then logged back in to Recent Trips and was able to add more.   What is reasoning behind limiting tip to $10, which for my trip was less than 15%??   I don\u2019t carry much cash and like to give good tip to deserving drivers, so really do not like this change in the App. Seems many riders will not take time to try to tip more than $1 or $3 or $5    Why did Uber make this change?",

He (the driver) doesn\u2019t respond to the other riders text messages or the one phone call she made. So she (the Co-rider) cancels her ride. So all the time and the distance he drove looking for that woman was added to my charge which ended up being a bit over $16. I go to help section and press \u201cdriver got lost or took wrong turn\u201d and was told my fare wouldn\u2019t be adjusted because I was charged the price I was shown upfront. I then press \u201cdriver took poor route\u201d and was told the same thing. I sent support multiple messages to support about the situation with no response. I even sent screenshots of his total driving distance (9.91 miles) and the true distance of my pick up and drop off which was 7.3 miles. My receipt from that ride shows a base charge, distance charge, and a time charge. Every ride I took that day that went from point to point with no problem don\u2019t have those charges. But because he drove so off course I was charged for the extra time and distance he drove. WHICH makes no sense since a Uber pool or express has a set route the driver can\u2019t deviate from.

I placed the order and it was quick. However, first we didn\u2019t get the cola that my husband requested and when he opened up the wrapper on the burger, he noticed that his burger was extremely raw. He immediately changed our daughters burger as well and it was also raw. Mine was not raw. So he was upset and called the McDonalds where we ordered from and the manager stated he cannot do anything for we had to call Uber. Upsetting as that may sound, it doesn\u2019t get any better for we\u2019ve looked for either and email or telephone number to Uber so we can get reimbursed for the two burgers and cola. To no avail. When you look for help none of the questions pertaining to this was available. There is not even an email so that I may write to them. Lastly when you sign up,, thinking perhaps I can get somewhere with this issue, it\u2019s more to become an Uber Driver. So I had no chose to whip something up for dinner for us to enjoy with the only thing was good was the fries. So, so disappointing for I lost my money on a nasty raw burgers and no drink.

Uber cares not about its customer base, and their system for accepting user feedback shows this. I am very disappointed. I understand this is a driver related issue, but I rate this app poorly because I\u2019ve searched through all Uber\u2019s \u201c report\u201d options & can find no way to report this type of behavior nor a way to get back the time I\u2019ve wasted because I\u2019m charged for the defrauding act of bad drivers & left w/ no course of action to remedy this problem.",

    "review": "Seriously, when it comes to car services, every problem I've ever had has been with Uber. First time, my mom and I got dropped off at the Greyhound bus station to catch our bus back home. We quickly realized that she left her cell in the car and contacted the driver immediately. He refused to bring the phone back to the bus station. He made us take another Uber to him 30 minutes away to get the phone. Mind you, he was simply sitting in a parking lot doing nothing. We then had to catch ANOTHER Uber back to the bus station. When that driver picked us up, he said that that spot was the area drivers sit in to wait for calls from the airport. Seriously? Second time, I'm waiting a good 15 minutes for my driver who appears to be lost and doesn't have sense enough to call me. Then I see the driver pass by me. I call him and tell him he's passed me. He mumbles something and hangs up. Then I see that I've been assigned a different driver. So, he cancelled me. Then he passes me again and just leaves. Are you kidding. There's no way he didn't see me. Third time, a driver tries to drop me off in a random spot that was not the address I gave. I then had to navigate him to the address with my own phone. I complained about the extra time charge and I am waiting to be refunded. Get better navigation and better drivers. In the meantime, I'll be using Lyft. Smh.",

This uber ride took 45 minutes because the Uber driver not only attempted to drop me off 30 minutes away from my house, but he was completely inappropriate. He was extremely upset for no reason. He did not want to take ubers maps, he wanted to take his own way which resulted in us getting us lost. That\u2019s when he attempted to just drop me off where we got lost. So I started talking to my boyfriend and my brother and they told me to tell him he\u2019s making me uncomfortable to please just take me home. So after going back and fourth about me not living in said lost destination, and him seeing me on my phone telling my fam what\u2019s going on he finally took me home. Which was so scary. I reached out to uber and they did nothing. They said they\u2019d reach back out to follow up with me because the driver was disrespectful. They never did. This driver was awkwardly quiet, only times he spoke his tone would stay angry and demanding. He kept sucking his teeth at me. He was extremely inappropriate & he blamed my destination for why he was frustrated. Nobody forced him to take my ride. I was so uncomfortable I had him stop a block from my house so I could walk the rest.",

The drivers themselves were courteous and professional, the problem was with the ride selection system and their near non-existent customer service.\nOn multiple occasions, the system selected drivers for me who already had passengers. I watched on the GPS as the driver drove 15 minutes in the other direction, leaving waiting on the corner for over 30 minutes. Of course if you cancel and attempt to get another driver, you are hit with a $5 fee for \u201cwasting the driver\u2019s time\u201d.\nOn another occasion, the driver showed up but told me he couldn\u2019t make the trip and that I had to cancel, costing me $5. After I contested the fee on the app, they \u201crefunded\u201d the fee, but only in the form of credit on the app. I had no intention on ever using Uber again at that point, so I attempted calling a customer hotline to get a real refund. It doesn\u2019t exist. There is only an automated phone line that directs you to use the app for assistance, and the app only offers an FAQ and very specific automated help. Apparently there is a actual hotline, but it is only for customers who pay extra for Uber Premium. Forget that, I\u2019ll just take the $5 loss and switch to their competition from here on out.",

    "review": "I typically only use Uber when I travel, and my first experience with Uber in Washington DC last year was fantastic.  I often opted for the cheaper Uber pool option. During a recent visit to NYC I realized the Uber pool option now requires users to walk a short distance. In theory, I have no issue with walking to get the cheaper rate, and I can see how it would be more efficient in cases where streets are one way and whatnot.  However, the GPS doesn\u2019t orient you and the pickup location is confusing. I would walk to a location only to see the driver would be at another location, calling me and asking where I am. The map doesn\u2019t orient itself according to the direction you are facing, adding more confusion.  This means I spent more time stressfully communicating with my driver before I\u2019m even in the vehicle just to find them, and if that doesn\u2019t work, you\u2019re out of luck and have to pay a $5 fine. Fix the GPS for walking. It should orient to the direction I\u2019m going, at least. Otherwise, offer a door to door pickup with Uber pool like it used to be. I\u2019m not going to pay $15 for an X when I can get the same trip for $5, but I also don\u2019t think myself as the customer or my driver should have to deal with a poor gps walking system implemented by Uber.",

Cancellation of the first Uber trip meant a half hour delay plus the traffic of the rush hour. So instead of arriving 2 hours and half before the take off, I arrived at the airport one  hour and 10 minutes before the take off which was late. So, my flight got delayed for one day and I had to pay for a fight change and one night hotel room. \n\nIrresponsible treatment from Uber and Uber drivers. Why Uber doesn\u2019t investigate such issues and at least give warnings to the irresponsible drivers. The driver knew that the time was critical because of the time and the road constructions.

So I check my banking account I had way enough money for the transaction also check my information it still was correct no problem. I contact my bank to see if they are the ones who declined my card. Wells Fargo says \u201cNo it seems like Uber is declining my card\u201d And was told to call them instead. So I contact Uber than explain to them what has happened. \u201cThey told me only certain cards are compatible with Uber\u201d I was like \u201c?\u201d. Please bare in mind I tried my Wells Fargo Debit, Credit, Easy Pay also PayPal & still it says the same thing. If I were to go on Lyft all of those cards including PayPal would works. This also happens on UberEats to. So I deleted the app because I cannot use my money on here. Than I gave it some time by waiting until more updates come in to see if they have fix this issue, however I tried it three times for once a month each to see if the updates would fix this. Still the same results, so I officially gave up on Uber/UberEats. My money going to Lyft & Post-mates.",

This is not only unacceptable but it is also frustrating because the app\u2019s SEARCH field does NOT allow the customer to specify the actual pickup address and it reverts to the app\u2019s default(s). Someone is making money by channeling traffic elsewhere (for additional fees and with added DELAYS); a blue \u201cbox\u201d locks you out but interestingly calling Uber for an inbound drop off to your selected location away from the main terminal is allowed. The current \u201crigged\u201d setup is also bad in case of an emergency because we can NO longer rely on the app to direct the driver where we actually are. Just for the record, there is nothing wrong with the GPS signal on our phone or iPad AND rebooting the app is completely useless, just like most of the developer\u2019s \u201ccanned\u201d responses. Looking back to find if our posted review(s) have been answered is futile and meaningless because there is NO useful way to search for keywords except for scrolling. Developer answers reviews selectively - SHAME! The app\u2019s review section should be limited to feedback about its FUNCTIONALITY (or lack there of) instead of a compilation of useless comments...Very disappointed...",

He couldn\u2019t find any due to his language barrier.  His last resort was to use his car for Uber in order to bit by bit pay off what he owes. \n\nThings were going good for a while until just a few days ago where he was falsely accused of sexual harassment by a rider. Uber took no attempts in investigating the situation and immediately locked his account. Mind you he had a 4.7 or above rating for his rides, but instead of Uber looking into it or contacting any previous clients, they immediately cut him off. The woman was a larger size, and she forced my dad to wait outside for almost 30 or so minutes, which cost her extra. In a lazy and underhanded attempt to get her money back, she took advantage of the fact that my dad didn\u2019t have a camera in his car and accused my dad of sexual harassment and force Uber to refund her money. This in turn locked him out of his Uber account ended his only source of income that he could find, and further pushed him down a rabbit hole of debt that\u2019s almost impossible to climb out of. I\u2019m very angry at Uber for displaying this little care in a situation and offering my dad no due process. Shame on you, Uber.",

I could get to work within 12-14 minutes, between $10-$12...ironically, those are still the times and prices with Lyft. Uber however, insists or overly long gps routes and outrageously priced trips.

I failed to mention, the route Uber\u2019s gps selected, took us all the way to the West End Bridge. When I questioned the driver on the insane route, he insisted that Uber requires drivers to take the plotted route. They base their rates on mileage and time in the vehicle right? Then why purposely make a 14 minute trip at peek traffic times, take 20 minutes when there\u2019s nothing happening...to overly charge their customers is the only thing I can think of. I get it, it\u2019s a business and business is meant to make money but that is wrong on every level. Their competitor, Lyft, charged me $12 on a Monday morning, going to work at 8:30am, during rush hour, and we the route took us over the Liberty Bridge which makes 100 times more sense. 1 star for the inconvenience of an app that boosts affordable everyday fares",

They also have reviews so that you can give your a good/bad review and they are Anonymous. Tips for your driver you can give them a tip after ride if you were satisfied.\nFeatures that I would recommend would one to have in tips in free way to were you watch an ad and then the Uber company and the diver split the money earn from the ad.

It is a shame that with all the updates Uber has went through that the developers still have not found a way to fix this. The developers of Uber seriously need to fix the app to where it alerts the drivers that the customer is on a military installation, and that if the driver does not have installation access to not take the ride. It is very frustrating for military to have to wait until the driver gets to the gate to find out that the driver can not get on the installation to pick the customer up. It would also behove them to make sure that a good majority of their drivers coordinate with the military installations in the area they are driving in to try to get access to them as this will gain Uber more business.",

Even when you send an email with your problem, all you get a scripted answer, which doesn\u2019t help, and that\u2019s it! So you finally send a second email, telling them that it didn\u2019t resolve the issue, just to get the same answer, which was copies and pasted by a next employee. Both me and my wife have exactly the same experience and problems. Neither of our accounts work and we can\u2019t get them to work and the there is no one to help.   I have never found any company, app or program where customer service is set up so poorly! For a company as large as UBER, there is no excuse. They get ONE Star until they clean up your act! New customers, be warned!"

    "review": "On 3 occasions over the last 12 months I\u2019ve viewed the route and price of where I\u2019m going & if it seems reasonable, I confirm the trip. I confirm the trip thinking the price I was quoted will be the price I pay, +\\- a dollar or two for some random toll or whatever. No, I went back to check my receipt to find out I\u2019ve been charged more than 2x the originally quoted price. If you\u2019re quoted $32, you expect to pay around that much. To be charged $70+ without your permission is criminal! Back when uber pool was still functional I\u2019d hear customers get in the car, make changes to where they were going etc, which makes sense to change things after your ride has been set, but if you get in the car & say hi & nothing else, not requesting other routes, why are we being charged more than double? The first time it happened I let it slide... 2nd time, eh it\u2019s a pandemic so fine. 3rd time?! I\u2019m honestly about to report it to my credit card company as fraud. Uber used to be such a great app but I\u2019ve seen much more shady behavior over the past year. Completely disappointed. You guys lost me as a customer tonight and will continue to lose more after people catch on. Good luck!"

    "review": "The application is good and easy to navigate through. However, there are a few inconsistencies which should be tended to. First, on several occasions I have not been able to see my \u2018earnings\u2019 or \u2018weekly summary\u2019. Instead, when attempting to view \u2018earnings\u2019 or \u2018weekly summary\u2019 the expected information does not show-there is just a blank screen. This is frustrating because it has happened more than once for longer than 10+ minutes. Unfortunately, this has happened while connected to WiFi and LTE. Secondly, this app drains the phone battery quickly. A suggestion would be to allow maps/navigation to route even while the phone is \u201clocked.\u201d Doing so would be more convenient and in the process not drain battery. Thirdly, when a customer sends a message, the message stays on the screen and keeps on popping up hindering the view for the navigation. Only clicking on the message, and then exiting out will clear the message from the screen. A suggestion would be to allow messages to display as a quick notification, just like a phone text message. In turn, this will help to not be so distracting."

    "userName": "NewsInfoReader",
    "review": "While Uber\u2019s prices have skyrocketed recently, now comparable to a Taxi ride, Uber\u2019s app still sets them apart from the outdated Taxi business model. The issue with prices has to do with the way in which drivers manipulate the system. They figured out how to turn off their app, find areas where other drivers have done the same thing, and then turn it on knowing the price will be higher due to \u201cfewer\u201d drivers in the area. In Seattle this is a huge problem. Something Uber has failed to address. In fact, recently I found myself actually using Lyft because they tend to have much lower prices yet also have a similar awesome app that makes finding a driver so easy. \n\nNo matter the case, Uber\u2019s customer service is excellent and they remain a contender against Lyft. But unless they figure out a way to lower prices, it\u2019s hard for me to say which service I\u2019ll use more often. After all, $10 for a 1.7 mile ride is very steep - the same (or more) than using a Taxi. And then hearing a driver brag about making $1500 a week because he\u2019s figured out how to manipulate the system just makes me think I\u2019m the one getting ripped off.",

Being I live in a small town, we never had Uber, until now! I then downloaded the Uber app and did the steps to open an account with my credit card and info. I picked the plan I needed and requested a driver. To my Suprise they had a driver pick me up within 3 minutes. Couldn\u2019t believe how prompt and professional she was. And FAST!. And she had a brand new beautiful car and was very accommodating. So sorry I forgot her name, but I hope Uber corporation looks at my review and can look up my last and only drive from Uber (but it won\u2019t ever be my last!), so they can give her an employee award or something. And when I needed a ride home she was there within minutes again. And again the price to take a Uber instead of a taxi is huge. Thank you Uber for offering your service in our small town. And if I could give more than 5 stars, I would."

I could see from the app that he was several blocks away, and it seemed that he wanted us to walk to him so he didn\u2019t have to drive through traffic.  I was visiting a new city, so fairly unsure where he was, and that is not how this is supposed to work.  The driver canceled the ride, but somehow I got charged for the driver\u2019s inconvenience; despite the fact that I was the one left waiting outside while numerous other ride-sharing cars pulled up to take passengers.  I tried to get another ride, but the fees had gone way up and the wait time was long.  I downloaded Lyft and had a cheaper ride within minutes.  I will say that Uber did credit may account after I complained, although it was a credit on my next ride and not an actual refund.

There was a bit of traffic so he asked if we wanted him to take an alternate route, when we asked if it would be faster he said yes. Of course we are going to say yes to beat traffic and if it would be faster. As he began driving a little I decided to enter the airports address on my own google map the ETA now said 10:25am, as he was driving it went up..he went the long route. When we told him he went the long way he decided to stop in the middle of the road and said no he didn\u2019t and asked if we wanted him to hop back on the highway..we said no just to keep driving since he was stopping in the middle of the road. He almost got into a few accidents along the way. We ended up arriving at the airport at 1035am and missing our flight and being stuck at the airport for 8 hours. When checking the Uber receipt it was about 85 euros, 25 more euros then the ride was suppose to be. I believe Tariq went the long route on purpose so I would be charged for distance and the total ride was an hour and one minute instead of 30. I was highly disappointed since I use Uber as a source of transportation a lot and mainly when traveling. Tariq made the Uber ride this morning terrible.",

Another horrible airport experience was when I got picked up and got on the freeway and headed towards my drop off a few minutes later my driver had to get off the freeway turn around and pick up another passenger literally in the exact location I was pick up from.

And after using it for 4 years I do find myself tapping on Uber more than other competitors but their customer service is REALLY kinda bad. If you ever need to write to them you would feel like you are corresponding with a bunch of robots as they are trained to cut and past standard answers from their library and often give you really stupid replies that do not make sense. \n\nOut of my 4 years experience using this app, I had to file complaints on 2 drivers. One being a super dirty slob that the car actually smells and filled with junk and rude and another one on his sexual harassment comments and questions during the ride. Both times Uber gave answers that are not satisfying. And the best laughable part is Uber\u2019s initial response to the latter driver was to give me $7 credit and thank me for being a loyal customer for over 700 trips! I was like \u201cwhat???!!!\u201d You gave me $7 to respond to my complaint on your inappropriate driver and not even bother to ask for details?? After writing few more complaints, a representative sounding extremely happy and joyful called me at 9:30pm to follow up on my very upsetting experience per my strong complaints...\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

The pricing is not that bad, as a rider you shouldn\u2019t tell the driver \u201cyour gps is messed up or taking us a longer way or what the case could be\u201d \n\nA rider should not seriously pay attention to the driver, if he/she is driving the wrong way or opposite way. there will be times, my drivers will take the total mistake as in he/she did not follow the directions or signs. he/she was a rider as us , they do not want to go into a taxicab as Uber is pricing just as regular yellow taxi . if Uber wants to make a rider not to completely take her/his time to tell a driver where to go . One of my Uber rides were from airport to home for my cousin, my driver who is supposedly from the city and grew up the same county as myself do not know any short way or avoiding the serious traffic. Please fix your gps very soon, or at least let the rider knew what way will be taken in the future , I agree with the previous writer . A rider should be allow to put someone who speaks their language instead a different language completely from other country . you want to make Uber more friendly and understanding to both driver/rider please hear us out !",

Ever since they recently priced their rides on a scale instead of a set price, I\u2019m getting charged much more and I can\u2019t even see why. I used to be charged 14-15 dollars to get to work every day without fail. Now, with the exact same route, it\u2019s 16-17. This is ridiculous and I\u2019m not even sure how it can be a law issue if Lyft hasn\u2019t done this at all. Also, what\u2019s the point of advertising a fixed rate for rewards members if you can\u2019t even provide it??\n\nUpdate: I understand that, I\u2019ve seen your copy paste reply to everyone who has an issue with the new update. It still doesn\u2019t explain why I\u2019m getting charged a couple dollars more when I joined a rewards program to avoid this very thing. What was the point of me doing that when all the \u201crewards\u201d have now been taken away? It also still doesn\u2019t protect me from drivers who\u2019d like to take advantage of this new system and take weird route just to jack up the prices.

For the most part it\u2019s convenient, useful, and wallet friendly. \nHowever, having recently encountered a technological issue I can\u2019t give this app the 5 stars I\u2019d like to. \nMy girlfriend ordered us an Uber and for some reason, the gps had us in a different location than we were. The Uber driver called us and we explained exactly where we were to him several times. He arrived late- which is okay. However we were later charged a late fee for something that was clearly outside of our ability to control. \nWhen I tried to challenge the charge through the app, it was immediately denied. I\u2019ve attempted finding a way of calling Uber to dispute this charge, but could not find any helpline. \nAny company that can\u2019t offer me a way to contact them directly about issues doesn\u2019t deserve 5 stars regardless of how good the app is. The customer service is horrible. My driver, I\u2019m assuming charged us for something we didn\u2019t do (we were waiting outside for him for about 7 minutes), and yet we\u2019re stuck with an extra charge and no way to explain our issue.

He drove us through weird streets in the OPPOSITE direction (15 minutes away) from our drop off location. He sat there for 5 minutes looking at his phone, then tried kicking us (my friend and me) out of his car (the driver barely spoke English so it was hard to communicate.) We told him he should honor his mistake and drive us directly to our initial drop off location, but he refused and YELLED at us! My friend and I finally got out of the car because at this point we were in that spot in his car for 10 minutes. He was being rude and greedy yelling at us to order the ride again but we refused. He left us there STRANDED. When I had first requested pool, the amount said $5.99. When I got out of his car, Uber had charged me $9.29! I contacted customer service and told them about my issue and experience, and they refunded me $2!!! I had to message them again stating I wanted to be FULLY reimbursed before they did something about it. Untrustworthy drivers and poor customer service. Use LYFT instead.

But then from 12 min it changed to 15min and from 15min to 17min. The time changed again once more to 15min. It was at 15 min for a good 20min. I noticed that the drivers location on the map was not moving. I zoomed in and noticed that he was parked in the near by Walmart\u2019s parking lot. At this point I messaged the driver and asked if he was on his way, and mentioned to the driver that I see that he hasn\u2019t moved in quite some time now. The driver never replied back, but started to move on the map right after I sent it, indicating that he got my message. At this point I\u2019m waiting again, but realize that he has gone to another location away from mine. Not only did the driver waste my time, I also missed going to the cook off because it was too late. I had to cancel my Uber ride and my plans for that night.

What work? We haven\u2019t seen this driver neither took that ride obviously! So you should reimburse her from your own pocket! We end up paying that last amount because it\u2019s even impossible to argue with you for the millions time!

The Help section of the app is an absolute nightmare to navigate and Uber\u2019s idea of providing customer service and support is a joke. I use them only as a last resort as taxis are more reliable and issues can be resolved through an actual customer service rep. The only good thing I can say about Uber is the quality of drivers. But, Uber itself is horrible!\n\n(Update: Based on the developer response, I see that they still don\u2019t understand that the Help section and the level of customer support are the main reason I gave the bad review. Apparently the only way to receive decent customer support is to give the App itself a bad review.  There are other ride options, with similar or better pricing, and with actual customer support should there be an issue. \nOne more issue to note: the GPS that the drivers are made to use is HORRIBLE.

Their driver support is purely an informational service that sees the system that is malfunctioning as some sort of untouchable deity. They used to have a phone number for the passengers who had issues as well to receive support but that is gone away now and I\u2019m thinking their service will likely start to die away if they don\u2019t start treating drivers well. Also many customers are unaware of the ratings system used. If a driver falls below 4.6 rating they permanently deactivate that driver and refuse to reactivate them later or even allow for any sort of appeal to the unfair ratings. They take the passengers word over the drivers and won\u2019t even listen to both sides of the story before making a judgement regarding that decision. Uber you have officially just lost a 5 year driver and passenger as a result of this.",

I paid over $1400 in hospital fees myself, out of pocket, because Uber was unwilling to give the full name of the driver or any other identifying information (and of course, it was a new car, so no license plate), which prevented me from accessing the police report in the city and getting my insurance to cover the hospital bill. Uber reimbursed my $8 ride, but did absolutely nothing to help me get in touch with the police department or aid in the reimbursement process. There was no apology, nothing. They did not care. Another time (before the accident), when I was on my way to the airport, I was left on the side of the road at night in an unfamiliar area because my driver decided \u201chis shift was over.\u201d As a young college woman in a large metropolitan area, it was extremely concerning for this to have happened. When I brought the issue up to Uber, again they reimbursed my $14 ride, but refused to look into the driver\u2019s file at my request or attempt to better their screening process for drivers. The driver received no repercussion. Extremely worrisome that Uber does not care at all about the quality of its drivers or the safety of their passengers.",

The uber driver falsely reported that I had lost my wallet and that it had been returned in order to receive $15. This charge caused me further financial issues. After reporting this issue to Uber through the \u201cHelp\u201d section on their app (which is the only way I was able to come in contact with an Uber representative), I was told that such a charge was not recognized in their system. After continuously trying to get in contact with customer support, I was finally told that the money would be refunded within 3 to 5 days. As of today, it has been 4 days since the money was taken out of my account and there has been no refund. This experience has caused me a lot of stress and has led to the loss of trust in this company. The fact that it was so easy for the uber driver to scam me out of my money has prompted me to writing this review as a way of warning others about this. I will not continue to use this app as I fear that another such incident might happen.",

I\u2019ll say I have been using Uber for the past 3 years. I\u2019ve had good drivers and bad drivers! Honestly these are people who use their personal cars to help others get to where they need to go! When I get into an Uber I really just want to get to my destination. The GPS sometimes take drivers to longer routes, but since I know where I\u2019m going it\u2019s not difficult to navigate your driver! If you know a faster route I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal to let them know. Secondly, everyone complains about rates! It\u2019s a service that you\u2019re getting cheaper than a regular car service, a $50 car service might be $15 with an Uber, I personally understand fare surges, and think based on the time of day it\u2019s fair to do this since they are sometimes not many drivers around. I use Uber and Lyft daily to go between work and home and the service has been awesome."

So that toke us like a long time, but finally she had to drive us in the most annoyed way, I wish someone teach her how to treat her clients and Uber care about this things"

Not sure what wait-time platform is being used, but it's certainly NOT true to schedule. When the app periodically gave \"slight delay,\" to those of us that use Uber almost daily....the company would send you a week of 50% off promo for a week. That was certainly an incentive. I've had a lot of \"slight delay\" trips and have recently received a 30% off promo. What is annoying with that, is that the app will quote a lower price and then conveniently shut down and when you open the app again, a higher price quote will appear. This past week, I've relied on good ol' yellow cabs to give me fairer prices. Especially with Uber pool...there should be a cap of pick ups! I've had to squeeze in very inconsiderate back seating because I have shared rides with more than four people. The drop off are also getting further and further away from your actual drop-off location as well.  All in all, the Uber conveniency is diminishing and the prices are not equating to the service provided. I hope this improves, because I am considering taking my frequently used services elsewhere!"

Don\u2019t even get me started on the cancel my ride option. I wanted to cancel my ride because the driver took 30 minutes to PICK ME UP. All because the GPS system was not updated and he could not find me and instead had to ask me for directions. I tried to cancel my ride but I had to pay???? For what?!?? I understand that they\u2019re trying to protect the drivers because some people cancel for no reason but seriously??? Because of that experience I had a horrible day and as much as I wanted to blame that driver, I knew it was the Uber company\u2019s fault. Update your GPS system for the love of all things holy."

Beware of the day where you get overcharged for a ride that you agreed to pay a set amount for because Uber rather have you pay for the inconveniences and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. Beware of moments where your order says arrived but by that they mean you can\u2019t find the order, your food doesn\u2019t get delivered but you still get charged and guess what? still nothing you can do about it. I mean you would think even when you spend hundreds with a company monthly they would atleast value your business as a customer. But this is not the case with Uber. Instead they leave you with a customer service message box where when they feel like they want to help you they can and when they don\u2019t want to help you they simply reply where you can\u2019t even send a message back to let them know how dissatisfying it is that your money was taken and no product was received. But this is how Uber lets customers know they are valued. Take it from me a loyal Uber customer for over a year who has had 100$ taken just to be told they refuse to reimburse me for the problems with THEIR app. That\u2019s the kind of brand this is."

I received 4 emails for the fare to/from the concert as well as what I tipped. However I noticed on my bank statement that there was an additional charge. The amount was small so I assumed it was a surge/convenience fee due to the concert traffic. I contacted Uber and sent them the info they requested only for them to say they do not see this charge on their records and to contact my bank. When I contacted the bank they just ended up canceling my card and will be sending me a new one. This is inconvenient since now I have to wait for a new card.

I closed the app. Open it again only to see that it mysteriously ordered a ride anyways. However it ordered the uberpool walking system, which I did not want. So while the app was looking for a driver, I tried to cancel. It then tells me they had a problem canceling my ride. It did that every time I tried to cancel. Once again, I closed the app, reopened it just to see that a ride was 6 mins away. Meaning it just came through. So I canceled and they\u2019re still charging me for a cancel fee.

If they are truly awful, you should be able to have an internal complaint system that ranks them and flags or blocks repeatedly problematic or dangerous fares. Even then, that fare should have an email, or in-app notification of the cause(s) for their ratings. As customers, we are asked what the driver did well, could improve, or should stop doing. I\u2019m sure they get that composite feedback so they can improve. If they don\u2019t, that too is very crappy. A scoring system with no background and real examples comes across a arbitrary, very petty, and subjective. Like, they can just ding a person because they don\u2019t like their looks or the fact that the tip is not what they think they deserve or in the form (ie, a nice wad of cash on the seat) they want.

    "review": "I hate the fact that you can\u2019t physically talk to a real person over the phone when you have a problem. Especially when it comes to payment and safety. Numerous times I have been picked up off the side of a busy street. Not at a light or a stop sign or a pull off road. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET. I have tried contacting Uber multiple times through email but they kept saying adjust your pin. Which I do and it keeps telling drivers to pick me up in the middle of a busy street. This is dangerous .\nAlso multiple times payment has been double charged and can\u2019t contact an Uber to fix this issue to make sure it will be resolved. Multiple times Uber drivers refuse my ride cause I have a service dog and so I get charged a cancellation fee which is paid with my credit card. But Uber wants to give me a credit. But lately no credit is showing up!!! Please give us a real person to talk to and not shove us to the side with a stupid email. This is annoying especially when I pay up to 40$ per trip. Like that\u2019s a lot of money for someone to pay and you can\u2019t treat your customers right. !!"

I have to reactivate my ride pass every month and never had any issues until yesterday when the app wouldn\u2019t allow ride passes to be purchased through the app for pilot program users. I contacted uber on facebook asking to be sent the link to activate my ride pass online as my friends who were noot able to complete the ride pass purchase on the app were able to do so online. I provided my email and phone number as requested but they never sent me the link and it was as if they didn\u2019t even read my message because they kept saying to purchase ride pass i needed to be eligible, even though i clearly explained i am blind and have been eligible, as well as have been using ride pass every month for over a year. It is not the first time they completely ignore simple requests online in my experience and often i am left with no customer support at all and having to resolve issues myself or by asking other users. As it has been said many times on here...the quality of customer service is non-existent and gets a 0 rating."

    "review": "Been an Uber customer now for roughly 3 years with nothing lower than a 5 star rating. Their service is good and makes traveling convenient, especially when out of state.\n\nThat being said, they need to work on their customer service aspect of their business. I had a driver who tried to charge me $80 in cleaning fees for no reason. He simply submitted a picture of a wet blanket on top of his car seat to Uber and reported me for things I didn\u2019t even do. Trying to get a hold of their customer service department took over a day due to high volume on the chat feature on their app. They quickly sided with the driver and it took some time to finally get the charge removed. However, now my rating is affected by this fraudulent driver who keeps banging his customers for cleaning fees and other false charges/incidents.\n\nI would recommend adding a 1-800 number for starters and suggest that Uber has penalties for its drivers who try to jack up their fees for no reason and lies about incidents. Again I have been a loyal customer for 3 years, with a 5 star rating and got no incentives from them to keep using their services. Instead I get an $80 cleaning fee as a thank you."

Uber then sent a second driver who seemed totally unable to find my house, indicating that she had arrived when she wasn\u2019t even on my street.  I called her and it was awhile before she could figure out where she was.  I then gave her specific directions how to get to my street (two left turns from where she was).  After waiting another 5 min or so I called her and she had made two right turns instead as that is what \u201cUberGoogle\u201d told her to do. She had travelledAWAY from my house!  She then cancelledthe ride ($5 my expense).  I had to start over and with a plane to catch!  After wasting 15-20minutes the rate was now more than double what it was earlier and I had to wait an additional 10 minutes to be picked up.   All in all I ended up leaving for the airport a half hour later than planned and at twice the rate. I did make my flight and the third driver was good but I then was not given the $10 credit on my first ride, was charged an additional $5 for a driver not showing up and then cancelling, and had to pay almost $25 more than if my first request was honored.  Really poor experience overall."

When I\u2019m waiting to get an uber, and the app shows 2+ cars literally sitting outside the building I am in, it is not fair or right to charge absurdly high surge rates. The fare to my house from work is in the $5.15-$5.95  range, but it surges to over $20 when it\u2019s \u201cbusy\u201d? Not cool. It\u2019s not busy if there are 2 or more cars sitting outside waiting, you can\u2019t charge surge prices like that, it\u2019s immoral and wrong and price gauging. \nAlso, you should not allow drivers to take a fare if they are still driving someone else home. Numerous times I get a driver, it tells me they are X amount of minutes away, but still finishing another trip, so the X minutes away keeps going up and up, meanwhile, another Uber shows up close to me that I could get but I can\u2019t because I have already been claimed by another driver that keeps getting farther away, and I\u2019ll be charged if I cancel with them. This is garbage, it should never happen. If a driver is still on another trip, it shouldn\u2019t be allowed to accept another one, but even if that happens, I should be able to cancel with no penalty.",

    "review": "So I was in a rural area, I needed an Uber home, it was a long ride and cost a lot ($107) but because of it being such a rural area, no Uber\u2019s were available. So after 3 attempts, I went over to Lyft, tried a couple times and same thing, no rides. Not a big deal, got a taxi instead and went home. Come later that night I open my bank app only to find Uber took $322 out of it for my attempted rides, even though they were never done and it doesn\u2019t show them on my app!! I contacted them about this issue, only to be forwarded a email \u201cwe are sorry for this inconvenience, your money will be returned to your account in 3-5 days\u201d so because of Uber\u2019s mistake I have to now wait multiple days to get over $300 back that they took (put a hold on) they then proceeded to try blaming this on my bank, stating that this is a very common thing done between all drive share apps. Meanwhile Lyft never took any money from me for my attempted rides, and after speaking to them. If the ride does not pair with a driver, they do not take the money. So I am out $320 for about 4 days, Uber services was no help in getting it back faster, and they lied about this being something all companies do.. will not be using them ever again. Snakes",

Maybe you can find a way to give the passenger the option of paying $1 extra on pool to be picked up at their actual location. \n\nAlso, I have had to direct the drivers not to take a particular route the GPS sends them on because it takes them up a back road and then has them crossing busy traffic with no signal when all they have to do is turn left out of my driveway and there is a signal right there to the same highway. \n\nAnd, is there some way to fix a location drop-off. My work address always takes them to the NORTH gate which has been closed for the past 7 years and they need to come to the SOUTH gate on a different street.

However the app is totally internet dependent, meaning that if your not connected to wi-fi the app won\u2019t work for you.

Hence my title, sometimes I request pickups but things come up and I am not able to contact the drivers or cancel my trip( not every location has wi-fi).   Secondly, the app has added protective features such as call 911 and share my ride with family along with app changes like rider ratings but these are more so-so  features that really don\u2019t change anything; if I have no access to wi-fi I can\u2019t use the protective features and the whole idea of rider ratings could be insulting to some people, Trips aren\u2019t free.",

Secondly, it\u2019s time for Uber to update their app and show the Pool rate *without* the walking option *before* a rider goes through all the steps to request the Pool. This is coming from a 4\u20197 woman who is not exactly comfortable walking around Chicago alone and putting her safety at risk just to save some money. I also have friends and family with disabilities that deal with chronic pain or have trouble walking, and they certainly don\u2019t need to be charged insane Uber rates on top of medical bills to get to places they need to be.

I was charged about 8 dollars for a ten minute ride then refunded and was charged more to 10 dollars and I was okay with that maybe it was an error, BUT exactly a week later I see in my bank statement and on my Uber app that I was charged for 40 more dollars ??!!! Obviously this has to be a a mistake but the fact that there isn\u2019t a customer service is crucially horrible. I didn\u2019t find this out till now. So people who take Uber BEWARE, they might over-charge you :/ trying to fix the problem right now with help but so far nothing. Update: I found out the driver put in a report that I messed up his car when I didn\u2019t, and I obviously can\u2019t prove anything but take my word for it, the driver will be dishonest and charged you personal fees. The car was already messy when I got in and the seats were stained, yet I was told with help support on the app that he filed me to make the mess when I clearly know I didn\u2019t and he knows. So Do not use Uber, the system for payment is horrible and they will cheat you out of your money. If you do take Uber take a picture of your ride inside before going in and after or else the Uber driver will charge you \u201cpersonal fees.\u201d",

    "review": "I went for my first Uber ride today, on Christmas Eve morning. I always treat people who work in service jobs well because I am acutely aware that they are often treated and paid unfairly. I had a nice ride with the driver, asked him about his holidays, etc. It was a 10 minute drive for $15 dollars and I tipped him $5. I also gave him 5 stars on the spot. (He said he was going to give me a good rating; I guess they rate their riders?) Well, this evening, I opened my email to a message that I damaged his car. Pictures were included of cigarette burns. Well, I do. Not. Smoke. EVER! Being anywhere near cigarettes triggers migraine headaches for me. And I certainly didn\u2019t cause that. The car smelled like it had been smoked in every day of its life, to the point that it was giving me a headache. I suspect that he wants Uber to recompense him for his already-burned car. I am furious, to say the least. I tried to call Uber, but it\u2019s funny how they are unavailable. It\u2019s an unfair mark on my name  and goodwill, and I can do nothing to fix it. I can\u2019t even amend my review of this slimebag. All I know is that his name is Abilio and he is driving in the Danielson-Killingly-Putnam-Pomfret area of northeast CT. I deeply regret spending my hard earned money and humanity on this company.",

This has happened before, I request a ride and it\u2019s searching for a driver but it takes too long that I decide to cancel it before they find me a driver so it gives me my refund back of the price the ride was supposed to be but sometimes it doesn\u2019t give me my refund like today. There\u2019s no way I can get my refund back because if I go on the Uber app to contact them about the refund it shows that my ride was canceled and it says I got refunded but I didn\u2019t. And like i said it\u2019s not the only time this has happened. So there\u2019s really no way for me to get back my refunds for trips I didn\u2019t even take that we\u2019re canceled. Also they charge way too much if your driver takes a different route or misses turns. I was charged almost 3 dollars more than the price it was supposed to be because my driver took a whole different route that was unnecessary and took more than 10 minutes when it was supposed to take about 5 minutes and had to take a different street because of road construction.",

I would also like to see an option included in the writers profile that would alert the driver automatically but they may need assistance. In my case, I am blind. Would like each driver to know that automatically rather than me having to necessarily text them every time. Thankfully, more and more drivers have gotten to know me in this town and I don\u2019t have too much of an issue with that. Been an Uber customer for over five years. Still love it. :-)",

    "review": "I usually never have a problem with Uber but I did this past weekend. I had ordered an Uber to a restaurant Philadelphia, which should only be 8 minutes away from my apartment but no. The Uber driver did not speak English and took us over the bridge into NJ, got LOST and missed many turns. We eventually had to pull up our own GPS and google translate, to help her and she almost ran a red light. She had no clue where she was and made me feel very unsafe in the car. This ride turned from an 8 minute ride to 30 minutes, making us late to an event. I was then charged triple the amount it was originally supposed to be. I contacted Uber support and at first they gave me a $5 reward after them charging me $27 (the nerve). I then further reached out saying I wanted a refund and they kept telling me they were unable to do so.... they eventually took off the $27 charge and charged me for what it originally was. I continued to reach out saying it was unfair I\u2019m paying for a ride that was absolutely awful but they were rude and refused to give me a refund. Uber needs to get their drivers and support contact in order because this is NOT how you treat a customer.",

When I arrived at Newark Airport on Wednesday Oct 4th morning at noon I called for a pick up went and told the driver I was waiting for my luggage he said he may have to move which he did and I was unable to get ahold of him to see where he was. I tried calling the number he called my and no response. I was charged for a cancellation fee very upset about that would like that refunded. Then called again found this driver and when we got to our destination the Staten Island Hotel he said he was a 5 star rating and on his phone proceeds to give himself that rate so wrong of him to do that. Then I tried Uber again on Saturday in the afternoon I called once again after I hung up I forgot to ask what color and type of car he was driving I called back could not get him very upset once again. I went through the Uber app and got to do you want to cancel it said click ok to cancel I didn\u2019t do that and continued to wait he never showed up and once again I was charged for a cancellation fee. Very very unhappy with this service will not recommend to anyone. \nStill looking for a number to complain about this terrible service. \nTeri Cernoch",

    "review": "I have used your app for 6 years and the timing is worse than ever. When I order a car the time it says for the driver is to arrive is grossly underestimated. Also, the timing changes. For example, I\u2019ll order it, it\u2019ll say 3 minutes to arrival and then flash to 7 min and then it will take 10 min. You certainly have enough data about San Francisco to have better timing algorithms. This is a major point of frustration and I\u2019ve been late several times. Finally, I go from my home to my gym a few times a week on Uber. EVERY time you recommend the driver does a u-turn on a busy road as the way to drop me off. So you know what? They drop me off across the street - which is a bus stop & technically illegal - and I either have to run through traffic or walk to the end of the block and wait for the traffic light. Your gps should pick a route that isn\u2019t completely ridiculous and that the driver will actually do. These issues get me so frustrated I have now switched to using lyft more frequently. Let me know when you fix these things and I\u2019ll come back \n\nI\u2019m adding I don\u2019t want a nickname to post this and it\u2019s really annoying that I cannot so it without.

    "review": "From the truly appalling GPS directions that send drivers on foolish paths, to the latest innovation of giving the trip to a driver that still has not finished another trip, the designers of this app have done a disservice to the brilliance of the original idea. Now when you look at the app and see ten cars just minutes away, don\u2019t believe the lie. Once you request the car, the app does not give you one of those many available cars, but instead someone who is much farther away and not finished with a current fare. Never used to be like this. No longer trust the App. Did they lose all the good designers?  Or is customer experience simply no longer a priority?  Definitely will start looking at Lyft to see if they can do better.  Don\u2019t know if they can, but Uber has lost any loyalty it built over the years.\n\nUpdate:  once again Uber shows disdain for customers, assigning trips to drivers who are far away and not done with a previous trip. Driver then cancels forcing rider to start over with another driver far away. Can\u2019t fathom why Uber isn\u2019t losing customers and market value hand over fist.

So the map makes them turn right into the opposite neighborhood to turn around. Every driver always tells me the same story that it\u2019s the GPS but it\u2019s not. On rides home, when I watch the GPS they always miss the turn and they always blame the GPS. It\u2019s not until I walk a couple houses down just so they can see me because if I waited at my actual address they would just keep driving up and down right past me. It always conveniently happens when I have to go to work. I always give a stretch of time that I would need to wait for a ride and yet 6 minutes turns into 15 or 20. Lovely app. Ok anyone can be a driver so long as they have no bad driving history but maybe there should be more requirements to see whether or not they can also navigate with a GPS. These drivers are complete morons and if the poor navigation werent enough, the chatty ones don\u2019t seem to know when someone isn\u2019t interested in conversation.

You should create a feature in the texting feature that has a preset text message for the driver to create or a toggle button such as the deaf or hard of hearing to be set up. Otherwise the driver has to constantly for each ride text or copy and paste a message into the text app to alert the rider. This can be time-consuming and very distracting."

My girlfriend and I were in the airport, requested an Uber ride, had to wait for 10 minutes. The guy stopped in the middle of the road, we asked him to pull closer to the curb because we were 2 girls with heavy suitcase and backpacks. He got mad and said he\u2019s not gonna do that because he has only 1 minute to pick us up. Fine, we carry our heavy luggage, put it into the car, then, after putting 2 of the 4 bags (we had 1 suitcase and 3 backpacks) he said it was too much and he\u2019s not taking us. He jumped into his car, lock the doors and immediately canceled the ride. Again, the ride was requested to the airport so it\u2019s obvious that there\u2019s going to be luggage. Then we requested another ride, again waited for 10 minutes and  another driver also refused to pull over closer to the curb (other drivers didn\u2019t have any problem with that). He didn\u2019t get off of the car to help us putting luggage into the trunk. ANYTIME we\u2019re using Lyft drivers help us with our luggage even though my husband is around (and we travel pretty often). Deleting the application and will never use it again."

And some times it\u2019s hard to communicate with your driver if they barely speak English. With someone who orders and Uber at 9:15 am car there within 3 mins. Have to be to work by 10 and driver goes planned route jumps on thruway hits construction traffic backed up. Gonna be late for work, and now it\u2019s not drivers fault, but your still mad because late and give them a low rating, that\u2019s not fair to customer for making them late and not fair to your drivers who take the heat for that especially you get an irate person with a chip on his shoulder.

    "review": "I wasn\u2019t going to write a review until I spoke with a friend who just recently had the same exact problem with Uber that I had several months ago. \n\nIn both of our situations, we were shown a fare for an Uber Pool, selected that trip, and some time along the way the fare changed to reflect an Uber XL trip which had a fare that was more than double what we were both initially shown. Obviously an error on the app\u2019s end. When we brought this issue up with several of the Uber representatives, they were rude, not the least bit helpful and insisted that we were the ones who approved the higher fare from the beginning, which was not the case for either of us. One rep even provided step by step instructions on how to delete the app for my friend- completely tasteless. \n\nSince then we both have deleted the Uber app and have given our business to Lyft, a business that treats their customers a lot better than Uber does, and knows how to handle customer service with class. We have and will continue to encourage our friends to do the same. I hope that Uber fixes whatever this issue is that\u2019s obviously recurring, though I definitely do not plan to use the service ever again."

    "review": "After using both the Uber ride and Ubereats services successfully for a couple of weeks, Uber suddenly just decided they didn\u2019t like my forms of payment attached to the app, and disabled my account. One was a Chase credit and the other a Chase debit. Chase confirmed the cards were fine, and we even stepped through all the Uber transactions I had  had to date, and all was well. I had great conversations and tipped all my drivers, so that wasn\u2019t an issue. After a few email exchanges with Uber support, they have yet to inform me what the problem is, except that my account was disabled and that it would remain disabled until further notice. ?????\nI\u2019ve switched to Lyft, and they like my forms of payment just fine and dandy. I\u2019ve also let Chase know what Uber thinks of their banking products, and that they should issue a warning to their other clients that Uber would likely abandon them if they use Chase cards. I\u2019ve also filed a complaint with my state\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office. Lastly, I\u2019m letting everyone know that I can that Uber may very well just shut you down in your time of need, and with no reason whatever. Go to Lyft or others, or grab a good ol\u2019 fashioned taxi. Uber is for Goobers."

    "review": "I travel alot and do not have a car, so I use Uber on a daily basis. Or shall I say, I used to use Uber. All I did was change change my bank card number couple months back, so because a few dates went unpaid they deactivated my account. I have every intention of paying these fares, just need access to account to add new credit card number and done. Easy right? A 20 minute phone call could clear it up? Nope. Uber doesn't allow calls, it's all email based customer service system. So, we are on day 76, and email 51 to try to get whatever fares I owed paid. Seriously, I counted. Every single email I send is responded back by a different person, so I would say roughly 40% of the emails are a generic automated response of 'just open your account and add new card', followed by that person closing the claim, then me having to start all over again. Seriously, hands down the worst experience with customer service ever. Even if they ever figure out how I can pay them to get my account reopened, they went from me using without second thought, to being my last possible option in countries without other ride shares. I really hope anyone in charge reads this. FIX THIS SYSTEM."

Uber has allowed riders to fabric stories to there advantage along with exaggerated complaints from the rider party without hearing the driver side . They would say people low ratings or all complaints are dealt with fairly this is not true . I dedicated my entire work ethic and long nights and hrs to being one of the best drivers to have a complaint fabrications towards me that cost me my survival , safety, and well being . This is not fair Uber doesn\u2019t investigate the situation entirely if a rider makes up a complaint because they tell you they are missing they train or they will miss their flight and get made at you and tell you they have faster route then if you switch lanes to cooperate with the rider then the riders get mad they missed train or bus they report you and if it\u2019s traffic they report you and say you driving slow or switching lanes. After thousands of rides and a few bad reviews not to mentioned alll my rewards and good reviews they deactivated my account Uber gps also makes it where you might have to do sudden turns because it was slow but it\u2019s all the driver fault I guess because I have been deactivated"

It\u2019s a good thing that they\u2019ve helped revive the job market, but this means that you get people with no customer service experience. Sometimes you\u2019re lucky to get someone who hates their job or used your ride as a vent session (I should seriously ask uber for my money back for these sessions if I\u2019m going to counsel their drivers) then you get beat up cars and smelly cars. The comfort of having uber was so that you didn\u2019t have to wait for unreliable taxi drivers. But now I\u2019d rather deal with them... I am one of those people who give drivers 5 stars because I know that everyone needs a job, but if i hate the driver, I don\u2019t tip. That says a lot!\n\nUPDATE: it would help if there was an option to choose the language my driver speaks. I feel rude as heck when I can\u2019t speak my drivers language and they are trying to communicate with me. Or I am trying to help navigate. \n\nAnd for NJ/NY users, we should be able to choose a driver who is able to drive to NYC.

Uber mysteriously did away with their customer service hotline and their email support.  We now have to communicate through the app and/twitter to receive any sort of interaction with their support staff, whom really seem to just serve as bouncers for the company rather than helpers for the people using their service.  I\u2019ve been sending them pictures of the receipts, updating on developments in the case, and asking for any sort of indication that they\u2019re receiving my messages; only to be met with disdain and utter dismissal for my attempts of communicating with them.

    "review": "There are fantastic aspects of the Uber app, but there is still room for improvement. Pool is bad for drivers and passengers; scrap it. Uber is not a bus. It\u2019s original scope was to keep it a private ride. Who wants someone you don\u2019t know riding with you; it\u2019s a huge security risk (Maybe they\u2019re drunk and I\u2019m not, or even worse, the opposite). You might say \u201cyou don\u2019t have to choose pool,\u201d but the concept is just a bad idea.\n\nSaving Home and Work pick up locations is a great idea, and being able to save destinations is helpful. But expand pick up location selections so we can name our own locations would be helpful. Setting up predetermined trips would be even more helpful. You should be able to choose \u201cPick up MOM and bring her to UNCLE JOE, etc. without having to manually plan the route each time.\n\nLastly, PAY YOUR DRIVERS MORE OF A PERCENTAGE. The quality of drivers and cars will increase exponentially if you take less and give them more (15% commission for Uber is more than fair). Anything more is exploitation, in my view. They are paying car payments, fuel, insurance, maintenance and more."

But I\u2019ll order an Uber at a perfect time, to where I\u2019m not late for work, but when I go to order the Uber the closest car would be about 10 mins away from me (which is perfect btw) but for some reason, I kept getting cars that were OVER 20 mins away (making me late for work). I just had this problem, I would cancel and cancel until I got a closer car, BUT THE SAME PERSON THAT WAS SUPER FAR KEPT ACCEPTING ME. I cancelled like 7 times (taking up my time) and I still couldn\u2019t get away from that person. That is dangerous and Uber needs to change that. If you cancel on a person ATLEAST twice, then that car shouldn\u2019t be an option for you anymore. I had to personally text that person to stop accepting me because they are too far. But once they stopped accepting me, well I got another Uber that was still over 20 mins away and I had to settle because all the cancelling was just wasting my time. Uber you should make it a priority for people to get the cars closer to them, and if there are none, then make the further cars available."

On a recent trip, unbeknownst to me, I dropped my IPhone somewhere in the vehicle.  I tried a number of ways to contact Uber with no success.  Finally, I set up an Uber ride, and when the driver arrived, told him my sad story.  He spent almost 20 minutes on the phone trying to make whomever was on the other end understand the problem.  When ending the conversation the driver still wasn\u2019t sure the man understood the problem, but if so, I should get a call within the next 2-3 hours.  That time came and went, And I was sure my phone was gone.  I put it on Lost Phone with a number to call if the phone was found.  Finally a couple of more hours and the original driver called, was still in the area, and brought my phone back.\nThere ought to be a better way to solve customer problems for a company that is world wide."

    "review": "I like using Uber, it\u2019s very convenient for someone like me who is unable to drive. But I would use it at your own risk because not every driver is professional. For the second time, a driver was unable to find my location. Which happens, that\u2019s perfectly okay! But what isn\u2019t okay is cancelling a ride after thirty minutes of being unable to find you which triggers a cancellation fee because of THEIR mistake. I was credited back the money I was charged but after reading reviews it seems this is a common occurrence. I ended up waiting an hour because I had to wait for a new driver, who didn\u2019t have any problem finding me. The worst part about it is I messaged the first driver twice and tried to contact him so that he could find where I was but there was no response, just a cancellation. And yet the driver was rated highly, even though I would consider this highly unprofessional. I hope that in the future Uber looks into this and holds their drivers a little more accountable. You can refund people their money but not their time, and thank God I didn\u2019t have to be anywhere while I was waiting for almost an hour."

I was in Las Vegas 2 weeks ago, had to walk all the way  to an isolated area for ride sharing, while taxis were available right outside the terminal. Had to wait 15 min for the Uber driver to show up despite the fact the app was constantly saying he would be there within 2 min. It was $15 to get to New York New York hotel. After subjecting myself to 2 more unpleasant rides with unprofessional drivers at Uber in Las Vegas, I decided to quit uber and use a taxi back to the airport on my return day. No wait time, no going all around hotel to figure out the ride sharing place, just got a taxi at hotel entrance doors. I was really shocked when I realized the cost was the same $15 with a taxi for same route. Goodbye Uber",

Also, connecting to the driver for pool shows a 2 minute wait. I know connecting to the driver takes time, but if you can always successfully connect at the end of your 2 minute count down, that means under the hood you are able be finder driver before that count down finish most of the time. So Uber is deliberately crippling the service to manipulate the users into using higher tier ones. Maybe those are common tricks many companies use.

But for the past week ALL of my Uber drivers have been late which is making me late to work. I\u2019ve tried scheduling the trip so I would get there 15 minutes before I need to be there and still ended up late. They\u2019ve matched me with people who are all the way across town and who don\u2019t even put effort to be there on time. I don\u2019t understand why they also have people who are still finishing their last Uber ride match with me when it\u2019s obviously going to make me late for the trip. Honestly I\u2019m just over getting frustrated about getting to work on time and not having to stress about it. Literally as I\u2019m typing this out I\u2019m waiting for a driver that should\u2019ve been at my house 10 minutes ago.. this is ridiculous\ud83d\ude10, update on my trip this morning, I called my Uber driver because he started going in all these different neighborhoods, and he literally canceled the trip.. now I have to wait for someone else.. at least he\u2019s closer\ud83d\ude10",

    "review": "So we thought of Uber first for New Year\u2019s Eve so that we didn\u2019t have to worry about driving home...we downloaded the app and added our payment method. It showed drivers on the road and we were all set. At the end of our night we opened the app and TRIED to order an Uber...we immediately got a message telling us that because of traffic and the holidays that we could not schedule a ride from a certain time on the 31st to the 1st?! What?! We thought we were stuck!! We opened the Lyft app that we downloaded as a back up and within minutes (2 mins to be exact) we had a driver right around the corner coming to pick us up!! I was so relieved but very disappointed in Uber!! I believe that this message should have been displayed when the app was downloaded so that people KNEW they wouldn\u2019t or might not get a ride!! I will never use Uber...only Lyft! Our driver was so nice the app was smooth and let us know who was picking us up and the car description and plate# along with real-time map to let us know where he was! Uber let us down on the most important night of the year when MOST people need a Designated driver!!",

The driver called me about ten minutes later to ask me where I was, and I told him that I was in the designated pick up area. He said he was dropping off another rider at departures and he'd circle around again to come pick me up, and I said okay; then he asked me where I was going and I told him. He didn't seem happy about it, and while I was trying to describe what I looked like so he could find me easily, he hung up on me. \n\nSeveral minutes later, he pulled up, picked up another rider that was standing a few feet away from me, and drove off, and my app said it was locating another driver for me. This new one was supposedly 13 minutes away. \n\nI tried to call Uber to see what had happened, but the automated system wouldn't recognize my phone number, even though it's not blocked and it's the same number listed on my Uber account. I tried to cancel this latest ride but Uber wanted to charge me $5 for the new driver's time. Instead, I had to contact that driver and he canceled the ride for me. I ended up taking a taxi.

I got charge randomly one time for saying I went all the way to the airport when I never did and I was going to the train nearby me. I did report a complaint and got my money back but that should not have happened in the first place because I did rate my driver after he dropped me off to my destination. These are poor drivers and need to hire ones that will take this job seriously. Not some half-assed lazy people. The GPS also needs to get worked on. It is very late and sometimes gets stuck at a random area when the driver have already reached my meet up point. The GPS also needs to get updated as well. It sometimes has drivers taking extra routes when there are maps that take a simple route. It also tells driver to turn in area that you cannot turn into because it's a one way road. This app needs to do a better job or else I'll going to be switching to a different app.",

Makes no since why I Uber doesn\u2019t have a customer service phone number we can call, or why can\u2019t I reset my password with my email. To me this is ridiculous!!! No one at the office seems to know anything either, they reference me to app. I\u2019m telling them I don\u2019t have my phone, how can I access app. I went as far as creating another Uber account to see if I can sign in and contact Uber, but because I have taken any trips on the new account I can\u2019t do anything. How is a company this big has such bad customer service. Right now I have no other options then keep going to office hoping the Uber guy DROPS OF MY PHONE THERE!!! This was the last time I used Uber.

    "review": "Dear Uber, \n\nI live in Seattle, a place where many people travel with dogs. I have had a few unfortunate situations where drivers have refused me bc of my dog, which SIGNIFICANTLY wastes time. I have to wait 1-2 minutes for the app to find me a driver, I (as the rider) have to send a message to someone driving a moving vehicle in traffic to let them know I have a dog, wait for them to respond (2 min), and then the drivers ask me to cancel (wasting more time). In the off chance the driver does not respond and they come to me only to let me know they are refusing me bc if my dog, another 5-10 minutes have been wasted. You need to update the app, allow a rider to proactively select if they are riding with an animal (service pet or otherwise) and then only pair them with drivers that have \u201copted in\u201d to transport pets because the waste of time is impacting my ability to get to work in a timely fashion. Additionally I have experienced situations where MULTIPLE drivers have come to me and cancel where the recommended solution above (or something to that effect) could greatly improve a users\u2019 (and driver) experience in this types of cases.",

Last night in Chicago I was charged a waiting fee because I had to cross the street! That one was not much, but it also was unnecessary!  I was also charged a surcharge, and I have no idea what it was charged for. That was in addition to surge pricing! Last month I had a similar experience in Providence Rhode Island. I was charged a rather large waiting fee ( with no warning or notification until the trip was finished) because the pickup place was changed, but there was no clear indication of where pick up was. In addition a large surcharge that was totally unexplained was added to my trip charges. There were absolutely no tolls involved in either trip! I do not like surprise charges added, and in some cases, a taxi would have been cheaper. If you are going to increase prices, it should be up front and explained!",

Recently, I selected a $15 trip and was charged $26 because the driver (who was nice) took a different route. I had a conversation with the driver about it, but he was simply following the directions given to him from the app. In the end I was refunded the difference, but it took some arguing and I ultimately decided to leave Uber because of it. This was the second time that had happened in a year. The rep I had spoken with about it called me noncompliant when I wanted to ensure that my fare was being adjusted. Uber is a good app for its purposes whose reps normally respond fairly enough, but it is still growing and being developed and I definitely need a break & some time with another app.\nThe UberEats fares are also pretty outrageous compared with other food delivery apps."

And on another note please also fix the lagging of the app itself it always says the car is 5 mins away and turns out they are very near or outside already, causing for the driver to cancel and passenger to pay that fee. Also the other most annoying and unreasonable thing that happens is when they connect you to a driver the app says there is one near or less than 4 mins away but somehow it always allows for a driver 10 minutes away to get my ride like why doesn\u2019t the app just not allow the drive to not get that ride since the main screen is telling us that there is another driver even closer it makes no sense to me"

But ever since the new  Uber pool walk feature it started to change. I don\u2019t mind walking to the end of a block for it to be more convenient for everyone. But I found that I\u2019ve been walking 4 minutes sometimes and to the point where the driver would have to wait for me to walk to them. I\u2019ve had a recent experience where my driver was incompetent and was driving towards closed avenues due to a firefighters funeral. He kept going around the same block. It took me more then an hour, to which I got out of the car and walked 15 minutes to my destination. Later I discovered the original $8 charge changed to $26.... I tried to use the app to refund me but all they offered was to reduce my fee to $15... I was really upset as I should have had that ride free due to the walk. Uber needs to look into changing this feature and needs to take that $15 charge out. I am losing faith in this company."

Hey cancel every rider and take in the dough!!\ud83d\ude21I tried to use you again later in the day and they said my account was no good and to add funds in my account..  so I did.

At the time of my request and after waiting more than 20 minutes to get connected with a driver. I was asked by the system to choose another ride because all drivers were busy I was bummed honestly and I\u2019m still waiting for my refund. I didn\u2019t want to waste anymore money and really needed to get home so I requested a ride with Lyft instead. I like Uber it\u2019s a cool app, however it seems like the majority of the time the drivers have gps issues when picking me up and of course it\u2019s fine when it comes to dropping me off. If some small changes could be added to the app to improve itself that would be great. I would like to see an actual customer support/service option for riders that actually allows you to speak to someone via phone/chat about any issues one maybe facing would be really helpful. Oh and one more positive about Uber is at least you may not have to wait too long. This morning I had to wait too long."

At the end I arrived at 4.45 and I order my Uber at 4.05... how do you explain that? It wasn't because of the trafic, nor the driver but because of you algorithm. You wrong people on the real time and then they have to wait and they are late for their appointment. \nYou recently launched the in real time localisation for the driver to see where he is. Except that the driver doesn't always check that so it doesn't work well and then I have to run to pick up my Uber... and now, in your customer service on the app, they deleted the section when you can complain about the drive so there is no way to have a compensation for the bad service.

But No they told me I already have way too many complaints. Now another time I used an Uber pool. My 13 year old daughter was getting picked up from her high school to home which was about a mile away. She got a pool. And the Uber driver went and picked him up. Now mind you my daughter was almost home. Tell me why the Uber driver kept going to the other passengers destination. Passed up Her destination. And they charged me  the amount he was suppose to pay.

I had a driver show up at my grandparents house where he dropped me off the week before asking if I lived there and if he could see me. I reported the issue to Uber and, over a year later, have not heard anything. Along with the unprofessionalism of the drivers. Uber itself is extremely unprofessionally and nowhere near customer-based. Unless you physically google \u201cUber Customer Service\u201d you wouldn\u2019t be able to get ahold of anyone from the app itself. Thirdly, the GPS system is absolute garbage.

We requested for over 10 minutes but could not get any driver to accept our ride. We used Lyft and they picked us right up. I asked the driver if he did both Lyft & Uber and he said he did. He told me my ride request never reached him thru the Uber app. This is really shady because we can\u2019t blame the drivers for not honoring our discount and Uber knows it!

The other day, the driver and I spent 5 minutes each trying to cross an intersection to get to each other. And the next Uber Pool rider had to be picked up in an extremely congested area with big streets so our driver had to pull two U turns. Luckily he was very skilled in LA traffic.

He went to ask what was my problem. My problem? I was just asking him about his policy. I agreed to not eat and yet he continued to be unprofessional. He showed aggression. I hope this driver never gets to ride ever again. I\u2019m not sure if he trying to be racist, cuz I\u2019m sure he gets this often. Plus i was only eating an apple.

Now the logical assumption would be that there were no drivers. However, thanks to the app update I can now see where people around me are ordering rides. Seeing as how I saw countless people be matched with rides (some even just several hundred feet away from me), it\u2019s clear there were drivers in my vicinity but Uber didn\u2019t want to match me with them since there were no other riders heading in my direction. Just a stab in the dark here - Uber didn\u2019t want to lose the money on a Pool fare getting a ride to herself. Within 10 seconds of finally giving up and cancelling the pool request, I ordered a UberX with the higher fare. I was matched with a driver within seconds. Shocker."

Not only are you liars but also scammers by using every possible technique to lure more customers with fake promises and fake reviews. Like I said, nothing but lies and more lies. Uber is trash.\n\nUber baits clients into hiring their services with fake time estimations, sometimes even by a difference of a whole hour of travel time. Embarrassing to place trust on such a fiendish company, suckering in innocent users. Shame on you uber and your developers for lying. Some of us have emergencies to attend to and we count on you! Terrible service to your clientele.\n\nYour reply to this review simply excuses you as if all these LIES were normal. Your reply shows how much of a tool to money you are versus actually being truthful to your clientele. Your ETA's are always off by an hour, nothing but lies! I have used your system enough to get sick of it. I'm always anywhere between 30 minutes to a whole hour late to everything! Eat your lies full of shame and reply with a proper response that isn't some stupid excuse allowing you to continue to perpetrate and push these lies to your clientele. Shame on you.

On 3 of those occasions I was not picked up by my driver at all; however, the drivers proceeded to confirm my pickup through the app and take my money without me even taking the trip. Whenever I tried to cancel the trip I was charged a cancellation fee. Whenever the driver cancelled, I was charged the full amount of the trip I did not take and one occasion I was charged even more than the original cost. Every time I have filled a complaint through the help section of Uber support, I received little to no compensation at all. Whether my trip was $10 or $30, my only compensation has been $5 in Uber cash. Which ultimately equates to absolutely nothing, considering the fact that $5 will get you nowhere, but perhaps around the corner in an uber. I have yet to be fully refunded. I have been using uber for 2 years now and I am shocked and disgusted by this new trend of just straight up, ripping customers off. I am tired of the incompetence of the drivers and the unprofessionalism of the Uber app and its help/support system. I would seriously consider trying Lyft before using this app."

I\u2019m able to see the picture of my driver and the license plate of my driver. \n\nOne thing that can be improved is the standby time. For example, if I\u2019m calling for a pick up, there needs to be some compromise of time. The 2 minute wait by the driver at the pick up location may not always work. How about a 5 minute wait? Sometimes the driver is not in the area and takes some time to get to the location. If the driver doesn\u2019t see the passenger/customer and has tried to reach them by phone, there should be a small charge of $2.00. This will be a small fee from the customer for not being ready for the pick up. Then, the Uber driver can cancel the pick up and move on to the next pick up. But this would only apply if the passenger is also ready for pick up and confirms that they are ready. \n\nConversely, if the passenger is ready for a ride and the uber driver takes 15 min to get to the pick up location, Uber doesn\u2019t discount the ride because there was no driver available within 5 min. The passenger just waits. So, how about give the customer a 5% discount coupon on the next Uber ride for being on time for pick up, especially on rides where the passenger waits more than 15 min for a driver to arrive. \n\nThink about it! \n\nSincerely,\nHappy Customer",

If you don\u2019t cancel your ride within the first two minutes than it will automatically charge you a fee. Which is fair I suppose. The only thing I don\u2019t like about this app is that you can only cancel and not be charged if the driver cancel on their end. So even if they\u2019re 10-20 minutes late and the fault is on their end you could end up with the bill. I think that app needs to give an option so that if the driver is late the rider can cancel. I\u2019ve heard from my brother, who also uses the app often, that some shady Uber drivers will just wait at location and wait for the rider to cancel so they don\u2019t have to drive them anywhere and save on gas. \nI\u2019m a college student I don\u2019t like having to pay for another ride just because someone is running late and I can\u2019t wait 10-20 minutes for someone otherwise I\u2019ll miss my class.

It\u2019s absurd and frustrating. The GPS tracking my area of pickup shouldn\u2019t be that drastic of a changed even in high demand it\u2019s quite unreasonable. \nThere should be an update for Uber where the price should only cost where you are going not your surrounding areas.",

It shouldn\u2019t be my problem if the uber driver can\u2019t find my address Or it takes 30 minutes when its says it will take 4 min on my app and he keeps getting delayed. I should be able to cancel without a fee and get another driver instead of waiting 30 min or longer. I accept it because the app say 4-7 mins. or else I\u2019ll find alternative transportation so im not late. Absurd that I get charged a cancellation fee when the issue lies with circumstances where I am not at fault.  At least with Lyft you can contact them to let them know the situation so the charge can be reversed. I only continue to use Uber because lyft isn\u2019t  available in Mexico or many other places.

The app is user friendly and I like that I can send my status to my friends. It is somewhat bothersome when a driver can accept my ride whenever he/she is >10 minutes away. This happens to me frequently at the airport and often they cancel because it is inconvenient for them too. So I end up waiting over 20 minutes for an Uber that may or may not cancel on me. I get that I can schedule a ride but it is nearly doubled the price. I don\u2019t fault the driver because I think that it is a system error. Lastly, I honestly wish I could rate my co-riders majority of the time they either keep to themselves or have pleasantries but those other times when they are rude and inconsiderate...well it somehow negatively impacts the driver and it isn\u2019t fair. Anyways I will still use Uber over Lyft but would like to see the issues addressed if feasible. Thanks",

Once he determined where I was going he chose to back out of the ride. I was waiting 15 minutes for this ride and I lived 15 minutes away. He wasted my time and made me feel like I did something wrong. I think it\u2019s time Uber get its act together or the government regulates it even more.

Since the update, I find that the app will have riders & drivers being forced to leave locations, which they have to pass anyways to a destination, in order to meet the other party. A perfect scenario of this is when I had a destination set for a certain block. Instead of being dropped at my requested location, I was taken 3 blocks away. It was my observation that the gps then told the driver to drive past my requested drop off point on the way to the next location. I know the driver had to pass this point because I requested to stay in the car, since I saw he was passing my location ANYWAY. Uber has created a new, very unsatisfactory system. I make this review based on experiences from 10+ uber pool trips at different locations & times. This new system is outrageous. The system was better before this recent update which included walking to/from destinations. The walking creates an inconvenience & confusion for uber pool drivers & customers alike.",

    "review": "There are quite a few things about the Uber app / service that are awesome. Normal transactions are effortless and I really enjoy the experience. When there are issues that need to be resolved, things get complicated and the path to resolution is unclear. I had purchased a coupon for my son who is living in Toronto with the impression that it could be used in Canada based on the description provided on the page where the coupon was purchased. Unfortunately, it can not. After multiple phone calls and emails to Uber and their 3rd party by myself and my son, we were unable to convert the coupon for use in Canada and I was unable to get my money back. The process we went through was very difficult to navigate and the result is less than satisfactory. In spite of this, I still give the service and the app 4 out of 5 stars because the normal experience is so good. A little better customer service on handling issues would result in a 5 star rating from me.",

I\u2019ve contacted customer service, they\u2019ve just told me that it was because of the authorization fee and they put it on hold and it was voided. When honestly, it really did go through my account and it was clearly deducted. And they\u2019ve said that they don\u2019t have any controls to that. (??) I\u2019ve even sent them screenshots from my bank account and they just told me that maybe someone from my household were also using my account. Impossible! Cause none of my family members nor my friends rides uber than ME, MYSELF & I. And they also said that those charges were from the past rides I\u2019ve been in, maybe? Loool!

Another problem I had was the Uber driver was taking a longer route and then what are you to be expected and I was late for my appointment and I told him to go the way that I needed him to go but he refused to and said that he uses the GPS and I was late for my appointment that was very important and I didn\u2019t end up getting the job for because of being tardy.

I wish that Uber would go back to giving ONE stable price and not charge the rider for little extra miles since it's not our fault the driver takes wrong turns or exits. After all, the driver is WORKING, it's a job, they should be professional enough to not constantly be taking wrong turns and exits since Uber tells them when and where to do so. I would like for Uber to ask before charging me if I allowed this extra miles that the driver took. They have \"add or change\" for a reason and if I didn't add nor changed destination then it's obvious I didn't allowed it.",

I was 15 minutes late to work due to the app not working, uber failed to let me know the ride wasn\u2019t available even 15 minutes outside my pickup window. Then when addressed about it the only solution uber has is to request your rides 30minutes early to give yourself enough time. Stupidest suggestion ever because i always give myself 40-50 minutes of time frame before my actual start time. Disappointing uber cant take responsibility, AND blames the riders for THEIR mistakes. Not to mention, the last 2 weeks my card has been ran 2-3 different times for an authorization hold when the ride was only requested ONCE & still didnt even give me the ride, putting the money in my acct on hold making me unable to even catch a lyft. And of course support always acts as if they cant find the charge because its only being \u201cauthorized & held\u201d NOT THE POINT. YOU SHOULDNT BE RUNNING ANYONES CARD MORE THAN ONCE WITHOUT PERMISSION, thats known as UNAUTHORIZED!! The past few weeks have been nothing but problematic.

If I had to \u201creview\u201d it however, I would say the maps need updating. There are roads that have changed, not so recently, from two-way to one-way. Signs installed that redirect traffic permanently, etc. As an app that focuses entirely on driving, routes, and maximising driver efficiency, staying on top of such things would be paramount. Maybe take a waze approach and have drivers submit closures & outdated routes. Not sure, you can do the r&d. \n\nThat\u2019s me being nit picky tho, uber could be a terrible interface and I would still use it. Safe, kind drivers, quick, and easy to sort. \n\nSide note, uber take 25% of the fare? Seems a bit much for a massive tech giant. Remember that your drivers have kids, hobbies, lives... without them uber wouldn't exist. Generosity goes a long way in the eye of the the 99%.",

I put a certain amount into this account every week depending on my schedule for the week. One time I put money in this account and shortly after requested a ride. Everything went fine! I go to request a ride home and my card was declined. Confused i look at my account and see 3 pending authorization charges plus the ride that was taken! How does this happen?! One charge is bad enough but 3 plus the ride?! I had to put even more money in the account just to get home. What if that was my last?

A lot of people didn\u2019t like the addition of \u201cUber Express Pool,\u201d but I thought it was a great affordable way to commute around the city and made sense; unfortunately, with a recent update a little while ago, the \u201cshort walks\u201d for express pool went from an acceptable 2-4 minutes to being up to 7 or 8 minutes sometimes! It\u2019s one thing to have people walk a few blocks to make it easier for the driver\u2019s route and save time, but when it gets to being that long of a walk, what is the point of ride? I understand I can change to normal Uber pool, but at this point the prices for that have become so inflated because of the addition of express pool that for someone who used to use Uber nearly every day, it\u2019s becoming impossible to afford. It probably has something to do with GPS algorithm or something, but regardless, that change has made me stop using Uber and switch to lyft a lot more often.. hoping this can be fixed soon...!",

He never entered that he had arrived because he probably couldn\u2019t when he was at the wrong address. I was charged $1.68 for wait time. I asked the driver about why he went to the wrong address and he became aggressive and offensive. A few weeks ago I received a call from a driver at 2 am. I was asleep in bed. He said he was waiting outside for me at an address that was three miles away. I never even ordered an Uber. I was charged a $7 cancellation fee. On both occasions Uber refused the refund and customer service refuses to answer my email. Uber was once a great idea but now they are simply criminal. Their drivers have figured out how to abuse the system and literally rob customers for false charges.",

The secondary person got the notification and then that driver canceled the pick up and another driver responded but all of a sudden the pick-up point changed from the drop off point to now being the pick-up point and the pick up point became the drop off. I tried calling the new driver, I tried texting the driver and I tried changing the pick up point back to the correct place but it kept telling me it was outside of my zone. Then when I canceled the trip I was charged a fee for the driver\u2019s time, which I don\u2019t mind, but come on why did the pick up and drop off points reverse themselves when the first driver dumped my request for no good reason. I have had nothing but problems half the times I use this app and today was the worst. It is also frustrating to see each time a driver refuses to pick up a ride. Once I went through twenty different drivers before someone finally said yes.",

    "review": "The arrival time of the drivers is never accurate! It says, \"1 minute away\" and it always takes the drivers longer than a minute to get to the pick up. If the driver is 5 minutes away, just put that. Don't have me expecting a driver in a minute, when that is not the case. It's worse when the arrival time is saying something like, \"8 minutes away\" and you are waiting up to 15 minutes. \n\nThe drivers never arrive in the time it says they will. One driver was a \"minute away\", and sat in his car at the gas station, and told me that was what he was doing when he picked me up 8 minutes later. There is always glitches in the app. Sometimes it is extremely difficult to get a car in the first place, and when you do they're \"completing a trip nearby\" which is not nearby. They've raised the prices significantly so it's not even an affordable option. The drivers are rude most of the time, but it all depends on the person with this one. Honestly, the service is only good if you are out at night and don't have a DD. It's better than drunk driving!",

    "review": "I have had Uber for years and have never had the desire to review until now. First, something needs to be done when I driver cancels the trip. If I am charged a fee when I cancel a trip, then I should be given money when they cancel it because it is an EXTREME inconvenience. I was waiting for a driver for 15 minutes and when he was almost here, suddenly it was cancelled. Then I had to find another driver and wait another 15 minutes and at that point, I had missed my appointment. \nMy other major critique is the new \u201cexact price\u201d. This may seem like a good idea, but in practice, it is costing me more money. I no longer get charged on actual kilometers or time travelled, but instead, am given a price in the middle of the usual range and it ends up costing a lot more. A lot of times drivers take different routes or take more/less time to get to the destination than predicted. Please bring back the price range, and base trips on actual distance and time. \nIf these two issues or at least one are addressed, then I will resubmit a positive review.\n\nThank you.",

    "review": "I have always loved Uber and had great experiences with both the drivers and customer service. This weekend I requested a ride to a destination about a mile and a half away. Somehow the driver ended up going the wrong direction and we hit a toll we shouldn\u2019t have. I said that it seemed like we weren\u2019t going in the right direction so when she got to the other side of the bridge she should turn around. She said she thought we were close so she already accepted another rider and would only be able to take us back on the other side of the toll. She tried to drop us off on the side of the road and the other passenger had to ask her to please pull up to the sidewalk for our safety. We had to walk close to a mile to get to the originally requested destination. I sent a note to Uber support through the app and they did not understand why I was dissatisfied or upset at all. They were only willing to refund me the toll charges even though the driver didn\u2019t get me anywhere near my destination. I am so upset and bothered by their reaction to this unsafe situation that I do not even feel comfortable using Uber going forward.",

The drivers should be penalized for that type of action. If you are on your way to pick me up already and I\u2019m not going to where you wanna go that\u2019s just unfair you just cancel and leave but i have to wait for a new ride if your gonna be in the app to pick up passengers and give them a ride then do your job don\u2019t cancel and cause an inconvenience for me that\u2019s just unprofessional on the drivers part and gives Uber a bad name.",

I needed a ride to the airport so I thought this would be a great opportunity to try it out. First of all, I wasn\u2019t initially able to schedule my ride. Then I solved that problem but the app wouldn\u2019t allow me to apply the promotion. There is no phone number to contact for support so I tried to get assistance through the conversation option on the app. It takes forever to get a reply. The people who responded tried to be helpful but the issue was never solved. I tried canceling my ride and scheduling it again and instead of the discount, the price went up almost $10. I left it at that and waited for my ride to pick me up at the airport. About 30 minutes before my Uber driver was supposed to pick me up, I received a message that my ride was canceled for some reason. I was so so frustrated through this whole process. I doubt I will try to use Uber ever again. So now in a rush, I thankfully was able to find a friend that is willing to pick me up to take me to the airport with such short notice.",

    "review": "I continue to use Uber mainly because they often give me discounts making it significantly cheaper than using Lyft. Some issues I have run into are driver accepting my ride request then going the opposite direction (forcing me to cancel so they don\u2019t hurt their acceptance rate while leaving me stranded and usually making me late). One driver I called to see what was up and as soon as I mentioned Uber, he hung up on me. Me other issue is with the walking pool option. I get what it\u2019s supposed to be but the few times I used it, it\u2019s tried to pick me up/drop me off at a dangerous intersection or had the driver drop me off somewhere sketchy when I was actually going somewhere on the main road. I suppose we can only expect so much of technology but still frustrating and nerve racking. Another issue is the rates not being set like Lyft, allowing the driver to increase your fare by taking a longer route. Irritating when you\u2019re trying to get somewhere in a timely fashion/on a set budget.",

I forgot a set of keys in the car and the only way to contact the driver is through the app with a return format, finally they transferred the call , the driver found it but he couldn\u2019t contact me, no records in his phone.  He is bringing my keys back , of course there is an extra fee of $15 dollars for that service. I am considering to try other company services , there are inaccurate information like the waiting time, distance of your driver  with the marching driver process, the system is just very convenient for them , the driver was waiting for me,  there is a fee for waiting and my phone shows he was 5 minutes away and the message I got was \u201cyour driver will arrive soon \u201c.. now the messages with Uber disappears so  users have no way to keep records of the transactions or error that the company make..",

Firstly, it\u2019s already incredibly passive-aggressive for this app to make me wait 2 minutes for absolutely no reason as it \u201cprepares\u201d my best route. Give me a break. This is just a way to try at my patience so that I will cancel and upgrade to an Uber X. I know there are over a dozen Ubers on my block at any given moment because I see them on the map and with my own eyes. But by god, I find it pretty sick that once my driver is actually selected, suddenly I am made to walk 4+ min to meet my driver who is arriving within 1. The absolute worst was the time when Uber thought I cold teleport 3 NYC avenue blocks (a brisk 8 minute walk for a normal, healthy person) within 2 min to meet my driver. Fortunately I can call the driver in person and explain my predicament so that I\u2019m not left in the dust for being late. They\u2019ve always been kind enough to wait for me.

After 5\u201310 mins Uber app stated unfortunately there were no drivers in the area. And canceled my ride. I called the phone number for the driver and it went to an Uber automated system.

I trusted that if there was any issue I could report it and it would be diligently dealt with, as this was my experience with customer service after 2 negative ride experiences among so many good rides. However, recently the feature to report issues and complaints changed and has become limited.

This DECREASES my TRUST in the app and the company\u2019s care. I would suggest that you switch back to the previous method or add a text option for the customer to be able to provide an explanation of what the problem was with the ride, to ensure you get the full and accurate feedback that enables you to improve the experience",

Sometimes it seems like they don\u2019t even come at all, and you will be charged a fee for not showing up. Despite either the driver not showing up or not even waiting a minute for you to get to them. I\u2019ve had numerous times where vehicles were different color than the ones shown on the app and yet I\u2019m the one penalized for not being able to spot the vehicle.\n\nOther than that, Uber has been good so far. It\u2019s low cost to ride. Quick and works like a charm most of the time. I would recommend this app and give it 4 stars if they would cater to riders a little more often.

My driver was friendly & had a pretty nice, comfortable car that looked almost brand new & had nice leather seats. My advice; if it\u2019s your first time using Uber & you don't mind spending a couple extra bucks go with UberX. It\u2019s only like 2 to 4 bucks more than Pool depending on the distance. This way you wont have to wait longer for an Uber Pool or share a ride. Much cheaper than a Taxi wether you choose Pool or X. A taxi ride from where I had to go would have costed me well in the $30 to $40 price range & probably would have been less as pleasant of an experience compared to Uber.",

However, since the pandemic which ultimately triggered in March for the U.S. the pool option on UBER  was no longer available- this was due to the social distancing regulations that were put into place.  With that said the pool was way more efficient for me and many other users, as I surveyed customers trips (mainly because it was way less to travel with someone) rather then call an UBER X and ride alone. \nAs a very big customer I feel if we don\u2019t bring this pool back anytime soon customers are going to shift to cheaper , more affordable prices.  UBER will certainly maintain status if it prices stay at a descent price for customers.  Happy customers make great companies. THANKS UBER for your commitment. \n\nBest regards, Vic DiBenedetto",

But the ride was perfect. I will definitely need them again because I need someone to pick my friend up at the house and then pick me up at hospital and then bring us back ( hospital won\u2019t let you leave alone a friend or family must be present in cab.) oh also to take me there first, it will be a good payday for one Uber driver, but anyways my ride and scheduling the ride was perfect and workout well, I highly recommend !!!!!  ,this business is going to grow pretty big.",

The amount of fees i had to pay because a driver didnt know how to work the app or because they didnt have common sense is too many to count\ud83e\udd2c.Somehow the same exact trips i take often become an hour trip when the destination will only be 15-20 minutes away. & You can forget about being on time with this app!

My complaint right now though is that it is nearly impossible to update your information without being logged into your account, but you need it to be updated in order to log into your account. It\u2019s completely counterintuitive. First I couldn\u2019t log into Jump because I needed to update my phone number, but I couldn\u2019t do so without logging in. So then as a workaround I re-downloaded Uber and logged in using my email. That went about as well as I could reasonably hope for, but then it asked me to enter the information for the debit card that was on file. I don\u2019t have that card with me or even know where it is. The number got stolen so I had to get a new card. So basically I can\u2019t now and probably never will be able to log into Uber or Jump ever again, unless I find a card that I stopped using half a year ago. Couldn\u2019t they just have you answer some security questions like a normal program?",

That being said - I use the \u201cbook ahead\u201d feature a lot. Last night I scheduled a ride for this morning. However I was not notified until the time of my scheduled ride that my payment would not go through (I recently lost my credit card which I am in the process of replacing). Therefore - I had to add a new payment method and book a new ride. I was headed to the airport so I ended up being on a much tighter schedule than I had anticipated. It would have been nice if I had been notified last night that the payment method wouldn\u2019t work so I could worry about it at that time.

May be handy at busy hubs to help recognize your ride. \nAnother thing is, maybe see if you can improve the GPS software somewhat. I often see very weird routs suggested to the drivers. When the drivers are local, they ignore that, knowing better. But when they are remote and pick you up after giving somebody a lift here, they just follow crazy path sometimes...

Recent improvements in the app and the search engine behind it are solid progress. My wait time has dropped and rides are showing up (versus cancelling on me repeatedly). Still, there have been a number of recent times when the fares are quite high (comparable to a taxi) and also seem to vary quite a bit. And the app itself on my mobile device are very reliable. The predictability still needs work but has also improved quite a bit. For its ease of use and constant and steady feature improvements, I give it 4-stars only because I think it can be even better in terms of predicting when rides will arrive and also when I schedule a ride, that they show up at the designated times."

    "review": "I recently used Uber for the first time, and found a first time rider discount online. However, when I attempted to apply it to my first ride it was not giving me the discount, even though it was legitimate promotion from their website. The only option for customer service is an email/instant message platform through the app, and I was never sure if I was talking to a computer or a real person. After explaining and re-explaining my issue multiple times and having cut-and-pasted and irrelevant info from their website sent back to me, I finally gave up. If I was indeed speaking to a real person, they literally were not reading my emails at all. For example, I was told that the promotion I was using was \u201conly applicable to rides taken between Nov 12th 2018 and Jul 4th 2019, so therefore it was not applicable to my trip.\u201d My trip was scheduled for June 5th, 2019. \n\nAs far as the ride itself, I was very satisfied with our driver, the use of the app for paying, etc. Uber is all good if everything works smoothly, but be prepared for an absolute nightmare if you ever need assistance with anything!"

Impossible to verify ride after you ve confirmed. This is important because if you make a mistake you would not know until your ride doesn\u2019t show up.\n\nAlso if the driver cancels the trip you can claim refund, but there\u2019s no way to send improvements notes to Uber. My driver followed the app to the address which was correct but the Uber gps sent him to the wrong location, a home street behind the hotel, I sent the driver 3 notes and tried to call. But he ignored my call, and messages and canceled the trip. This caused my business card to be charged and now I have to explain  bogus charges on my card and report that to my company. It would be preferable to have my card refunded instead for business travel. \n\nI think it VERY important that I can make a complaint about the driver ignoring my notes and phone calls, but no way to add these notes..."

I had someone steal my credit card information and somehow was able to access my Uber account. When I contacted customer service I was not able to find anyway to talk to a person on the phone end it took a very long time to resolve using the messageing system with customer support. I was left unsatisfied with that customer support experience. I also noticed that sometimes drivers don\u2019t make much money at all on a short trip even if they had to drive very far to pick the person up. I would be willing to pay a little more if they have to drive more than 20 minutes to my location. Over all the passengers experience is always great and I will continue to use Uber because of this."

It will tell you seven minutes then it will jump up to 10 minutes and then it will say arriving now. Very in accurate.  \n\nThis evening it said meet your driver now I walk out no one is there so I text them. They replied shortly later and said I\u2019ve arrived but the app still said they were two minutes away\u2026 \n\nI\u2019ve usually been pleased with drivers/cars etc. Tonight decided to Uber because it was so cold and didn\u2019t want to have to park or get into a cold car. When the driver arrived the car was freezing not sure if I was his first ride and it also smelled weird. On the return home, the car again was freezing almost as if the heat wasn\u2019t working or on & the driver barely spoke English. Unfortunately, this was my mom\u2019s first time using Uber and she was the reason I took it. She has had several surgeries and gets cold easily and it\u2019s hard for her to walk far distances.  \n\nI like using Uber  and until this evening have had pretty good experiences. I also have a good rider rating  and would like to keep it that way.  Is there a way that I can request to not have a particular driver/car pick me up again? Hate to seem picky but when I\u2019m spending money I just don\u2019t like to be in a car that smells weird or is cold!\nThank you\nTeresa"

The driver saw me and passed me by. He claimed to the app that he was waiting for me for too long when he didn\u2019t even pick me up. I complied to the app and it \u201crefunded me\u201d but later on those credits were gone and I didn\u2019t use them. It keeps asking me for the money I don\u2019t own and it\u2019s not the first time this happens. I had some credit from a horrible trip in which the driver was talking me to the wrong location even tho I mention twice where I was going. Uber refunded me but then again later on that money was gone and again I didn\u2019t use it. Those were Mexican Credits. The only credit that don\u2019t go away are my US credits. I have $5 dollars, but whenever I try to use them it just doesn\u2019t let me. I kept pressing the option of \u201cUber credit as payment\u201d but it\u2019s useless it doesn\u2019t accept them.

    "review": "App used to be much better.  Now it will show you a driver(s) nearby (maybe 2 min away) when you requested a ride - and then when you're connected to a driver, it's a driver who is now 7 min away and is completing another trip.  This didn't happen two years ago. Then the time to arrive will constantly fluctuate up and down by a number of minutes - even as the driver gets close to pick-up. This didn't happen previously either.  Also given the inaccuracy of the mapping, providing just the car type and the license plate isn't helpful if half the cars are the same (say, a Prius in Seattle) or there are no front plates in a state (say, N.Carolina). Adding car color would be helpful to identify an approaching ride.  Also apparently the app no longer shows the driver what side of the street you located.\n\nAll combined, I can't think of one change to a once excellent app that has improved the customer experience."

I still haven\u2019t gotten the refund and after the same driver came to pick me up and I asked him why wasn\u2019t he moving. He said he was already at my house and he doesn\u2019t know why the uber app said he was still at the location he was when he accepted my ride. He said there was something wrong with the Uber app. I swear there\u2019s always something wrong with this app. The location pins be wrong not only with the passengers but with the Uber drivers.

    "review": "Their customer service is horrible. I had a driver once tell me that when the passenger canceled a trip then complained, uber took the cancelation fee from the driver in full to reimburse the passenger. In other words even though they take 20% or whatever percent of the fare. They made the driver fully reimburse the passenger. In addition, Uber takes the most out of the drivers. They charge fees and taxes but when the driver gets their information - they don\u2019t include that the amount the driver receives is post tax so now the driver claims taxes on taxed income. Another thing is their customer service! If you tell them \u201chey, i\u2019m upset my driver accepted my ride and put they arrived AND started my trip but then cancelled\u201d they\u2019ll say \u201csorry for the inconvenience but due to the fact that you weren\u2019t charged, we cannot reimburse you\u201d - then you can say \u201coh i don\u2019t care about the money i\u2019m just upset said driver started the route and now knows my destination without servicing me\u201d they\u2019ll just end your conversation.

I requested a ride that was a 6 minute drive from my location and was matched with a driver 10 minutes away even with other cars in the area. I was charged a fee even though I immediately cancelled because walking would take me less time. On my walk I even walked past an Uber whom was parked and waiting for a request. Lastly, the rides are becoming way more EXPENSIVE lately and 100% of the time it is cheaper to use the local city yellow taxis. Uber used to always be cheaper and was an advantage because of cost and ease of use and services. Although the application and service remains excellent, the cost advantage is no longer there and it is more often than not a few dollars more than a taxi lately."

Once we waited for over 20 minutes and the driver couldn\u2019t find the way and we had to cancel it. The next driver also took longer than usual. Tried to call but the line was always busy. Turned out the driver was on the phone talking to someone. He was on the phone the whole time during our 40-minute trip. Then there was this time when neither the driver nor us could connect to the server and the trip wouldn\u2019t start. Of course the driver wouldn\u2019t go without the trip started and we had to cancel the trip. Not to mention the other day when the app didn\u2019t work for no apparent reason at all. Now this afternoon I couldn\u2019t take a ride due to my Paytm account having \u201cinsufficient funds\u201d, because the 350 Rupees withheld for an earlier trip was not released and I was 0.03 Rupees short. Seriously Uber, do you have to withhold 350 for a trip that costs less than 150? I had over 800 Rupees in my account and couldn\u2019t take two trips that cost about 400.

This time the driver was sent to a location several miles away from where I was at and where Uber acknowledged the pickup point was located. Then the driver called me. Asked me to edit the location. I did but the money grubbing hog Uber proceeded to say to me I was out of pickup range. So the driver said I had to cancel and request again. I did and the same driver now comes to me. I get charged over $6 for Uber complete screw up. I cannot find how to ever speak to anyone or get any response to any issue with Uber. This is terrible customer service and if Uber does not fix this and contact me I am going to explain this to all I can reach on social media. This is the last straw for me on Uber screwing me out of money for their complete failure. At this point it appears that it is all calculated and targeted extra charges and a planned money stream. Cancellation charges for not showing up or sending the driver to the wrong place is fraud and I have had it. What say you Uber?",

I was running late for an event so I had to cancel and re-request an Uber to get there on time (which eventually arrived). They later charged me $5.25 for a cancellation fee. I issued a dispute for this charge since the cancellation was entirely the cause of the driver who did not show up. The fee was eventually refunded to me via PayPal.  This was in January 2020. In June, I decided to give Uber eats a try (I usually use Postmates) and placed an order. While submitting what I thought was a payment for my food, I get a confirmation that stated that I had paid the $5.25 from the \u201ccancelled\u201d ride in January!

Uber refunded it but the audacity! Who can I bill at Uber for wasting my time? Time wasted while your app takes considerably longer to call Uber pool so u can group as many people together as possible. What\u2019s in that for me?

However booking return rides from Logan to my home have resulted in (1) error messages that the booking failed and/or the network is inaccessible, and (2) repeated attempts that take about 15-20 minutes to finally get through. This may be a Logan Airport peculiarity but since I fly out of Logan 2-3 times each month, this is problematic. Also a return flight just a day ago had both the limo and Uber services pick up their passengers in the same pickup area. Awkward. And per usual, it took 17 minutes to get a response out of Uber. If the limos weren\u2019t all committed I would\u2019ve been tempted to book one of them just so I could get home 20 minutes faster.

Along with that, I wish that if the driver canceled on you, they were penalized in the way of cash rather than their star rating. Because i know that there are people that have 5 stars, cancel one trip and they got canned for it. It\u2019s not an uncommon thing. But, just overall a better way to run your business would be good.

Stop over charging on fares when other customers cancel as well and figure out your GPS system that makes you drive around an entire neighborhood to ensure other riders are found when you\u2019ve been waiting past the time you were scheduled to be picked up at. Also, drop the rate your passenger features, it\u2019s been discovered on multiple forums that drivers are purposely rating passengers lower for petty reasons.

It used to be one of my first choices, but now it\u2019s become quite the last resort.\n\nWhenever I request a pool (being that they\u2019re generally cheaper than an X or other versions) I have to wait anywhere from 10-20 minutes for my driver to arrive because for whatever reason the drivers that receive my request are always coming from the complete other side of the city. And even then, it takes minutes before I\u2019m actually connected to a driver. What happened? I used to wait probably two to seven minutes to be picked up, so that\u2019s quite a significant difference. \n\nCalling an X can be a nightmare because of the outrageous rates nowadays as well. I remember it used to be more or less $7-$10 to get to most places in my city, but now it often costs upwards of $15-$20. \n\nI understand there are a lot of factors that contribute to these differences, like traffic and demand, but I can\u2019t help but feel like there could definitely be some work done so that this service appeals to everyone rather than those who can easily spend $20 on a 15 minute ride without worry.",

Imagine living in a world where the drivers drive like it\u2019s Grand Theft Auto risking not only your life, but every single person around them. There used to be a rating system here, but fairly recently (around April 2019) they have removed the ability to rate your driver, but strangely they can still rate you. I heard a rumor once that they give you a bad rating for not tipping; I am glad it\u2019s not like America where your rating actually matters. Here in Bahrain I could literally have a 0.00 rating and nobody would look twice. Another thing I have to say is a fair amount of these drivers can\u2019t read or speak English. All in all Uber in Bahrain is a necessary evil because companies like Lyft haven't evolved enough to be out here yet.

People call Uber for safety reasons, weather reasons, and many other reasons that have to do with their not wanting to walk.\n\nAs of late, I have had to wait 8+ minutes for my Uber. I have never had this issue in the past. My last driver made me wait 14 minutes and the number kept increasing until I inevitably had to cancel. Are you really pairing riders for the most efficient route if the driver must drive 14 minutes in the opposite direction? (Literally, he kept going North, away from me).\n\nYou might say that I simply pay more for the non-walking option, but that still doesn\u2019t take away the issue with poorly paired riders and routes. I\u2019d rather pay the SAME amount or less on Lyft, since they 1) won\u2019t make me walk, ever and 2) actually pair the riders well.",

    "review": "The Uber concept is great and far superior to hailing a cab. However, about a third of my trips go wrong wherein the trip is canceled before the driver gets there, for no known reason. Then, after waiting, you start over. On rare occasions this scenario played out more than once on a single trip. Then, I find that I have been charged for the trips that the Uber driver canceled. So, I go through the hassle of disputing with Uber. They state that they will credit me for the erroneous trip, no problem. But then my credit card statement comes and THERE\u2019s the CHARGE that was never supposed to be. I shared my frustrating stories with several coworkers the travel heavily like me.  They quickly advised me that they had similar experiences, and that Uber was a hassle, and that they all switched to Lyft, which in their opinion is superior to Uber in every way. I will follow suit and see if they are correct.\n\nFollow up:  I\u2019ve now used Lyft for a handful of rides. Very similar to Uber in form and function however, no false charges nonsense.",

It\u2019s ridiculous because why would it cost $22 AND $45 to go the same exact distance. I\u2019m using Uber more because of the pandemic but these price gauges is outrageous and is the first time I\u2019ve ever paid $40+ anything for a 20 minute ride.\n\nAnd don\u2019t get me wrong, I understand the situation is a bit unique but the fact that they initially told me my ride would be between $19 and $25 but then changed it to $45 is just crazy because that\u2019s $20 I may not have had. I put in a complaint and they gave my $11 \ud83d\ude11 like they could have at least gave me half of what they stole like $15 or something. I use Uber A LOT and now I\u2019d rather take the bus.

So I waited patiently as I watched her drop off her ride 5 minutes away from me. I watched the little Uber car move towards my turn (at this point let the car guy know what time I would be there). Then I saw her pass each little turn she had the opportunity to take to pick me up. She then proceeded to park in a residential area and wait. I can only assume she wanted me to cancel so she could still get the fee. So I waited. She was supposed to get me at 623pm for a 645/7 arrival to my destination. She canceled the ride finally around 643. Connecting me to a new rider. I canceled the ride to find another way to my destination to no avail. Was forced to order another Uber. He actually showed up and it was a very pleasant ride. Unfortunately Dawn has ruined Uber for me and I will not be a returning customer."

She decided to drop us off next. We arrived at our hotel over 1 1/2 hours after we were picked up! She said it was Uber\u2019s fault because they tell her where to go... but couldn\u2019t she have refused at least one of those other rides? Either way this is totally unacceptable!

    "review": "Uber is the absolute worst of the rider apps.  If you\u2019re in nyc, use Via.  Anywhere else, use Lyft or absolutely any other app.  Uber drivers are fine, but the app will give you unrealistic arrival times of your driver (My last Uber said it would take 10 minutes to get to me and took more than 20 - so I missed my train, even though I paid for an uberx that estimated my arrival long before my train).  This is of no fault of the driver, as this is a consistent issue.  Uber is also more expensive than any other riding apps. AND, if you try and cancel because you can see that you\u2019re going to miss your train and it\u2019s not worth going to the station anymore, they charge you even though it\u2019s been more than double the time promised, unlike other rider apps that give you a full refund when they screw you over.  In summary, if you HAVE to Uber for a 10 minute drive, make sure you leave 30 min ahead of time or you\u2019ll end up sitting in the cold rain for an hour waiting for the next train.  Maybe it\u2019s better in other countries but Uber absolutely bites in America."

Either way, my $24 ride suddenly became $65 due to it not being flagged as completed for at least an hour or so AFTER my trip was finished. I really tried to report this bug/error however it doesn\u2019t fit at all into Uber\u2019s very narrow support pipeline, so I had no way to fix this except to click \u201cthis charge doesn\u2019t reflect what I was presented up front\u201d which is a very blunt fix and doesn\u2019t reflect my use case. They offer no methods at all to write in your specific issue. \n\nAs a result, I felt trapped and almost thought I was defrauded because the driver didn\u2019t seem to notice or care that it wasn\u2019t marked as completed and I only feel lucky that they didn\u2019t actually steal an extra $40 from me, because I did at least have the ability to contest the charge. Since I have no other way to share this situation Uber, they get a bad app rating for such a bad support experience."

It\u2019s been 3 months now fighting with Uber about how to get a refund and stop my subscription as they keep telling me to go into my app and select cancel, however, Uber Pass isn\u2019t even an option in my side bar and they make it impossible to get ahold of anyone from customer service. I am incredibly disappointed because I\u2019ve never even used Uber before yet I was automatically signed up for a $10 subscription each month that I have been unable to cancel. I know I am not the only one having these issues. I removed my card information in hopes of them not being able to charge me anymore but I hope that I am able to get a refund. As a college student who doesn\u2019t need this subscription and hadn\u2019t even heard of it before, I am incredibly angry at Uber for enrolling me in this and not offering any support on how to cancel."

Of course there are good things about them, and some drivers are truly incredible because of what they bring to the table, but this is mere happenstance from the benevolence of humans, not from a company that strives to deliver a great experience everywhere. Uber can\u2019t even bring themselves to comment or reassure their customers in the face of scandals, frequently \u201cnot being able to be reached for comment,\u201d or replying to such a request.

Perhaps this is typical of my home in West Midtown, Atlanta, but every time I request an Uber, the driver does not know where to get me. I set the pickup location quite clearly, yet I see the driver, almost every time, turning around several times \"1-2 minutes away from me\" before finally getting to me. They are usually late, and the \"X minutes away from you\" indicator is almost always wrong.\"\n\nFurthermore, today it was raining. I called an Uber, she came, and as I approached the car, she rolled down the window to ask if I was receiving a call from her. This added about 5 seconds of rain time before I could get in the car. I understand concerns of safety, etc., but rain is rain, and typically when I approach a car and obviously acknowledge I am supposed to get in (and similarly the driver signals as well) I expect the door to be unlocked. I both felt unwelcome in the car, and was far more wet than I should have been. It was raining hard. This is bad customer service.\n\nAgain, I will reiterate that I love Uber and generally think it is fantastic as an app once I get in the car, but I am generally dissatisfied with pickups, as I have had repeated issues with them.",

They get some money and you\u2019ll be stuck at your spot until the next crap driver comes along. If this is the case, screen record the incident and make sure to report it. They\u2019ll affect your rider rating for the stupidest reasons. Doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re sitting in the back minding your business. They will ruin your rating & let\u2019s not get into the price of this app. You\u2019re better off calling your local cab service. Don\u2019t tip these drivers, they don\u2019t deserve it.",

Went thru the motions to hire an Uber and was told to cross  over from the baggage area to parking area approx 50 yards away. Did so and found a group of people also waiting for the Uber with the word Uber posted on floor at the edge of the drive. Email said driver was within 3 minutes.  We waited, after perhaps 5 minutes we got a call and the driver wanted to know where we were?  We responded, where are you? Finally we saw him drive by behind us and park about 30 yards away in a regular parking space and if we had not known the color of the suv and ran to it we would not have been riding with Uber.  This is the first time in Seattle or the airport and I feel to be charged a waiting time expense is unwarranted .  The driver was excellent and brought us to our Hotel but the Uber experience was less than pleasant.",

So the vomit got in the car accidentally while she opened the door and threw up on the curb. But did we say we wouldn\u2019t pay the fare or cleaning fee? No. Then what\u2019s the reason of kicking two girls out in the middle of the night while yelling \u201cGet our of my car\u201d then charge a $150 cleaning fee which I didn\u2019t even get the service that I paid for?\n\nThis was a very unsafe trip with this unprofessional driver and it discredits my impression with the whole Uber community.

Then the car is often late to arriive or sometimes doesn\u2019t even bother driving towards me. So I end up canceling and calling a cab which comes in 5 minutes. Then Uber charged me a cancelation fee which when I try to dispute it, they make it clear will come out of the drivers pocket. It should come out of Uber\u2019s pocket. They caused the problem.

    "review": "While I generally do love Uber, and use it as a regular means of transportation, one of the problems I frequently encounter is the GPS lag on informing me of where the driver is located while en route. Even shutting down the app and relaunching doesn\u2019t help. This leads to a lack of knowledge about whether I\u2019ll make it to my destination on time, which is an extreme inconvenience. The second, and last problem, is that Uber could afford to be slightly more cost efficient for those of us who use it almost regularly. Buying a pass seems to be ineffective and essentially rounds out what the general cost would be without the pass. Besides both of these things, I do like Uber. \n\nOn the plus side, the drivers are very friendly, with clean vehicles and safe driving. Of course there is one out of a hundred who are a little rough, but apart from that, the drivers get 5 stars from me."

    "review": "Usually have a good experience with Uber but tonight my husband took Uber from Athens to Atlanta GA to pick up his truck. The driver said he had an emergency, his girl who was 3 months pregnant was having pains and told my husband to get out of his car at a gas station and told him to call another Uber. He left him in the middle of a really bad area of Atlanta where he had to wait 40 min for another Uber. He tried waiting in the gas station after buying food and drinks and they told him he had to get out and stay outside. It was also cold out and he didn't have a coat or hoody because he wasn\u2019t expecting to be abandoned in Atlanta.\n\nThe guy outside told him he was a crazy white man for standing out there and he shouldn\u2019t be there and he needs to get a ride as quick as he can and he wasn't laughing when he said it. He was concerned and warning him. \n\nWhat if my husband got harmed in anyway? What if I was left out there? This is unacceptable! \n\nI understand if emergencies happen but if you know you are on call for a problem or situation you stay in YOUR CITY you don\u2019t endanger someone else by dropping them off in the middle of crack town. \nMy husband will be calling to complain to Uber once he gets to his final location.\n\nThe first driver also charged full price of the ride and my husband had to pay additional for the second ride.\n\nThe second driver was shocked at where my husband got dumped and said it could have been really bad for him."

    "review": "Ever since I started paying cash, I have countless times been charged more than the upfront price for no reason at all (I simply go from A to B with no setbacks of any kind unless the DRIVER makes a wrong turn or something), and Uber doesn\u2019t even care as they do absolutely nothing about it. They can never give me a straight answer as to why I was charged more (they couldn\u2019t find one if they tried), they simply send me a pre-written response and accept robbing me. They claim that \u201cthe fare can change due to traffic or time taken\u201d or whatever, but nothing ever justifies the fare I\u2019m shown at the end, which often is double what I was shown upfront, and all I did was go from A to B. I took Uber for years and only recently did this start being the case (supposedly). If the fare almost doubling for no reason at all was just going to start being a thing, they should have sent out an email about it because I never would have agreed to these fares, and it\u2019s unfair to trick customers like that.

After being cramped in a small Lief car because we are in a \u201cpool\u201d service, he dropped us off on the corner of Catalina and Elizabeth streets which is 3 blocks away from our destination.  He said that because we are on pool status that is where he should drop us off instead of on the actual address.  After an hour-long trip and with my knee problem, walking the 3 blocks was complete torture.  This trip cost us $33+    If this is the kind of service your drivers provide to handicapped senior citizens, I think I have just done my first and last trip using UBER \nI would like to add that the two young passengers who rode with us earlier were brought directly to their doorsteps while these two handicapped seniors were dropped off THREE BLOCKS  AWAY from their destination.

I tried to use the pickup point version but the map display was incredibly poor.  No street names on map, my position not at all clear, no way for me to pick a point and walk to it cleanly and clearly with photo landmarks and something to confirm that I am walking in the correct direction.  After I walked a block in the noon sun the app put up a large blue area circle without any explanation of what it was for.  It became even less clear where or what in this city I was supposed to go for my car.  At that point I canceled and walked back to where I started and ordered an UberX.  Two dollars more but a nice clean car, safe, good driver Estrella, and no-problem ride.  The pickup-point app needs a lot of work; right now even paper bus maps are better."

This last ride, I called at 4:55. I finally got into an uber at 5:25, when the original ARRIVAL time was around 5:30. (RIDICULOUS btw, so now I am definitely late to an event that I don\u2019t have a lot of time at)At least own up to the fact I\u2019m arriving in 40 minutes instead of 15 because drivers are going in circles.

After I wait and my ride comes and the ride ends. I get a bill of $15! \nWhere did this amount come from?! I check the receipt sent to my email and I see, booking fee, surge x1 fee, and LONG DISTANCE FEE! I was like what the heck?! \nUber Why are you charging me extra for something as ridiculous as long distance fee, when you\u2019re the one who picked that driver to come in the first place. I feel cheated and ripped off. The ride was supposed to be $10 but became $15 due to Uber trying to secret cheat the customer.\nAlso Uber also tries to make you automatically give tips to the riders now. When you are giving the rider a rating, make sure you remove the $1 tips and click $0 as tips, as Uber expects you just to click done without realizing that they now automatically have the tips set to $1 instead of $0. Disgusting.\n\nAnd no guys, my Uber barely waited long with me or else I would\u2019ve been charged a waiting fee. \n\nI have deleted Uber app off of my phone, and will be going to Lyft. \nAnd I don\u2019t want to hear and BS of oh, \u201cwe\u2019re only trying to support our drivers due to the covid 19 pandemic , that\u2019s why we add extra things.\u201d No, you guys are trying to take advantage of an pandemic to make more money."

For example there are some double decker roads in Chicago and it has shown the route to make a turn from one road to the other that cross over each other and do not intersect. Routinely the app tries to get drivers to make U-turns which are illegal in Chicago, so it seems they need to improve their navigation to improve the customer experience and keep drivers from getting tickets. \n\nMy greatest grievance is the false advertising of wait times. There is a perpetual 6 minute wait that after happens. In reality the wait time starts out really low like 3 minutes but than increases to about 6 for 6 minutes until the car arrives 9 minutes later. \n\nI do love watching the car do the electric slide all over the map and Tokyo drift around corners in slow motion, except when it looks like the driver passed me up, so that could also use improvement.",

I\u2019m highly upset about this situation and the fact that they didn\u2019t bother firing this driver means that he got away with it and will continue to scam others. I recommend NOT using Uber at this point it\u2019s ridiculous how someone can scam you and the company does nothing about it.",

A bit of a damper on the night out but definitely not the end of the world, I just messaged customer support and my friend ordered another one through her app. I tried to reach out to uber, as I have done with previous fare issues, and explained the issue. I offered that I had screenshots of the driver not picking us up and driving the wrong direction, as well as a call log that shows he was unresponsive. Uber told me that between his account and mine, his won. I don\u2019t have a bad uber rating(above 4.75) and I offered proof but was told to shove it. Eventually my fare was refunded after screenshots and some upset messages were sent but they never apologized for the poor ride experience or for a rather long message they sent me telling me I\u2019m a liar that customer support felt was appropriate. I took screenshots to back up my case when I realized he was being odd, but apparently I should take them more often as this company has atrocious customer support and some very shady drivers.",

It does not make sense to have you walk up a hill after your driver drops you off and then said driver commences driving up that very same hill passing your preferred location on the way. The location is not in any major intersection and just as easily could have been a drop off point.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a fault of the driver but more so of the technology that determines the drop off point.

Second thing, Uber Pool rider matches. The app will match you with a co-rider that is wayyyyy in the opposite direction from where you currently are. Example, I\u2019m on my way to work this morning and I got about 7 mins from my house headed to work and the app matched my pool with a rider that was almost 10 minutes in the direction that we just came from. Very stupid if you ask me to have drivers backtrack to pick up other pool riders and an inconvenience for people that actually have somewhere to be by the \u201cestimated time\u201d that Uber shows upon pick up.

When people see that you were blind if you were handicap and they drive right past you into die you service they start you have a service available. There\u2019ve been times when this is happened where I was left out in the freezing cold or a snow blizzard. This is highly at all except a bowl and I am waiting for the chance for over to fix it. When the driver is the W now they just pass the request on to another driver and act like they have never seen you. Their information is scrubbed out of the system so that you cannot report them. This is an out rage."

There are always two or three cars near me when I confirm the order, but the driver who takes my call is always the one very far away, usually more than 7 minutes away. What happened to the 5 min rule? Then, the driver who takes my call  is already busy, taking some one some place else. 10 minutes go by, and finally the driver is about two blocks away from where I am, but... the driver just cancelled my call, disappearing from the app map. Worst part, I get charged but no one picked me up. I write an incident report but get no reply. 15 minutes later, I finally flagged a Taxi. I am heading towards my destination, when I noticed in my Uber map some other Uber driver arriving at my origin address to pick me up. Did the original driver cancel the call but placed my call back on the system? Too unorganized. Now I am forced to call my bank to block the charge that Uber will not reverse."

I am beyond frustrated that for several times now, whenever I enter certain addresses to be picked up at, Uber can just never get it right. I requested my Uber before 5pm so I could get to work by 5pm. Yeah I expected to be a little late because I requested late but it should not have taken me an hour to get to work. My Uber was sent on a goose chase trying to find the location I was at. I texted them and called them on the phone SEVERAL TIMES and could still not figure it out because of the apps poor map system. I had to cancel the Uber, walk 10 minutes to another area where Uber would pick up my correct location and request the Uber again. So I ended up being an hour late to work and that\u2019s just not acceptable. On top of that, they charged me 5 dollars for \u201ccanceling and for my drivers time\u201d but what about my time? I lost money because I was an hour late due to extremely poor navigation issues and something seriously needs to be done about this."

The driver was convinced I was going to get sick, to which I suggested he pull over and I would get a different ride, he refused! We safely made it home, however the next morning I was charged for \u201cthrowing up\u201d in his vehicle. First and foremost, I didn\u2019t get sick. Secondly, I reached out to uber to which they responded with photos of what looked like water stains? - what happened here was the driver was tired of driving, took advantage of my illness, wouldn\u2019t pull over so I could get a different ride, and then I was charged the most you can get charged for a cleaning fee. Just because you have my card info does not allow you the right to charge me, this is stealing in fact. I immediately deleted the app as this is not only terrible customer service, but also completely wrong. DO NOT USE UBER! If I could give them negative stars I would."

Uber customer service will not even respond to an email from Amex sent to the Uber ambassador. What do I have to do to get this resolved contact Uber\u2019s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi directly?

This was incredibly stressful as I work for a major air carrier out of IAD. My flight was the last flt to DC leaving at 3 and here it was already 2:30. Finally one of my friends came to get me and I arrived at RDU with no minures to spare and was boarded with fellow travelers just in time. I was communicating with driver by leaving him texts as to my apt location and how I needed to get to the airport quickly. Just when I think he is minutes away, it would change and he would drive in the opposite direction. I wish I had taken the car and driver info so I could report him to you. I still use Uber as it is a necessity, but I was very mad and upset which is no way to start the beginning of the holiday and my trip. Just needed to vent, other-wise my experiences have been very positive. Thanx for hearing me out. JS"

What blows my mind in a negative way is that the app doesn\u2019t give a push notification like everything else saying that the driver is at your pick up location. You either have to watch the app like a hawk to see ON THE SCREEN that the driver is there or some are nice enough to message you that \u201cI have arrived\u201d.

This is extremely inconvenient for the customer because the customer has to write a complaint to seek a refund. If the customer is too busy and doesn\u2019t have time to write to customer service, then Uber gets to keep the money they incorrectly took from the customer. Additionally, last year Uber\u2019s bot response was so flawed because instead of using me a refund, I was blamed for the driver cancelling my time when I waited for him the entire time. Not only did I wasted my time waiting for him, I was charged $5 when he cancelled. This further delayed my trip.

For instance, I searched the menu for a way to rate my driver; I finally had to select \u201cbad experience\u201d to pull up the rating stars and see an opportunity to leave a note. This should be linked under the record of rides. For each ride, we should be able to rate and leave a message.  I received a notification to rate my driver but when I clicked on that I got the home screen and had nowhere to go.  \n\nThe way drivers are located and tracked is amazing. Even the purple color screen was a big help when I spotted our driver\u2019s car in the busy airport but lost track of it in a lineup.  I\u2019m a first-time user and I\u2019m already hooked on the process of finding, paying for, tracking and linking up with the car.",

I quickly learned that Uber has a 50% chance of either being perfectly fine or an absolutely terrible experience.  You\u2019re taking a gamble whenever you use the app.  In a span of less than two weeks, I was charged a bogus \u201creturn item fee\u201d and a bogus \u201ccancellation fee\u201d.  Both instances were messed up.\n\nThe \u201creturn item fee\u201d must have been some error or mistake by the driver.  After all how can you charge someone a \u201creturn item fee\u201d when the driver didn\u2019t have anything to return?  Nor did the driver return to the drop off location or contact me to return anything.  Uber ended up refunding me thank goodness.\n\nThe \u201ccancellation fee\u201d experience was just odd.  I provided the pickup and destination addresses but the driver chose to go to another pickup address.  The app kept bouncing between showing his eta of 2 mins and then saying he had arrived and was leaving soon.  He did not even bother to come to the address I provided then cancelled the drive even when I called him.  Then Uber charged me a cancellation fee.  I\u2019ve been back and forth with customer service on this.  \n\nBoth experiences are just really disappointing.  I\u2019m fine with getting hit with a fee if I am at fault for something but I\u2019m not cool with getting penalized after doing nothing wrong.",

I found that the pay was fair and the drivers were enjoyable. Over time however, the service became more of a headache. What started as a $7 trip to work soon fluctuated to anywhere between $10 and $14, not including a tip. It became difficult to request a ride sometimes, despite there being drivers in the immediate area. If that weren\u2019t bad enough, my most recent experience was with a driver who got to the top of my road, cancelled, and then when I re-requested him again, not even two minutes down the road, he cancelled again, not stopping or slowing down. I was able to get another driver, who spent at least 5-10 minutes in a Burger King drive thru and proceeded to eat during my 5 minute drive, which is very unprofessional.",

I pushed again and was told Peter was on the way. After about 10 minutes or more, he contacted me that he was having a problem at my gate. I said that I would come to the gate to help him. When I got there, he was backing out instead of pushing the button for the gate to open. After he backed out, I tried to enter his car, but he said he already canceled. I have been picked up at my office at least 30 times by Uber. How this driver wwas incapable of pushing a red button and pulling the ticket is beyond me. He and the driver that cancelled before him wasted 30 minutes of my time.  I went back upstairs and arranged for one of my employees to drive me  I did not order another uber but one showed up anyway. I told him that I made other arrangements. Please make sure the penalty is reversed. Also please discipline peter for his extreme inefficiency. Leonard Roth ( a frequent Uber rider}^",

I think there should be more work done on the app end to correct the issue so riders don\u2019t have to call the Uber drivers and give the correct pickup locations. The other issue is how slow the app updates. It will tell me the driver is 2 min away and I\u2019ll make my way to the pick up location, but after the trip, I\u2019m charged a wait time fee unnecessarily. The wait time fee explanation says Uber charges the rider if the driver arrives and waits more than 2 minutes, but the app counts from the \u201carrival soon\u201d notification vs the \u201cmeet driver\u201d notification.

Happens too often that i request an Uber for a reasonable price, have a driver accept that is over ten minutes away, which in some cases is far too long to wait, for instance when you\u2019re on your way to class or work, causing me to cancel and search for someone closer. When I go to find a new driver to the same location, quite literally a minute later, the price has gone up significantly. This morning I had an UberX go from $22 for a ride across San Francisco, to $37 in the same 60 seconds. Sometimes Uber is my only option of transportation. I think it\u2019s unfair to have prices go up and down in such a way. Constantly checking uber for ten minutes will guarantee a better price but will result in being 15 minutes late to class. Not worth it, but at the same time it\u2019s almost unaffordable at times to be punctual. With that being said, drivers are great 9 times out of 10, and the app works well.",

If you try to change payment method after, you can only do it if you have more Uber cash than what the ride cost. I lost my $15 of Uber cash for January because they wouldn\u2019t let me change the method IMMEDIATELY after the ride.

Recently my Uber account was hacked. I immediately notified Uber. They then sent me a link to change my password, but unfortunately the hacker changed the phone number on the account so I am not even able to change my password. I have been trying to gain control of my account now for over two weeks without the help of Uber who I have been trying to communicate with via email because they don\u2019t even have a direct phone number. I have been given the run around so many times it is ridiculous. Right now I just want to gain control of my account again so I can dissolve my account. So disappointed in this company!!!!!\n\nUPDATE: Uber confirmed my account has been hacked by someone in Russia and still has not helped me gain control of my account. I have had to contact the attorney general to help me with my case.",

We picked up another rider along the way, then when we dropped him off the app or driver marked me as having been dropped off (despite being miles from the address I\u2019d entered). The driver did not speak any English, so I was unable to communicate to him what happened. Instead, he started driving in the other direction and picked up 2 other fares before realizing the app was never going to drop me off and letting me enter my address in his phone. I was finally dropped off an hour and a half after I\u2019d been picked up (it was supposed to be a 20-30 minute trip, even with other riders). I contacted Uber\u2019s customer service reps who respond with obviously prewritten replies that do not address the content of my messages and state that, because I was marked as dropped off (at the wrong address!) the trip was within the estimated time provided - seems like their customer service dept is designed to frustrate you into submission rather than legitimately address riders\u2019 concerns.",

I called my doctor to see if I could still make it, but they said it was best to reschedule. I informed the driver of this and asked him to let me out. I live on 141st street in Manhattan. I got out at 135th street in Manhattan. The Uber charged me for the entire fare of going to 57th street. I was not in the car, the driver did not close out my ride when I got out. He lied on the app, saying I got out at a location I did not depart from. Just to make a few extra bucks. \n\nI informed Uber about this and thought they would reimburse me the difference. They are currently telling me that I entered in the wrong location and they are not making any adjustments. \n\nBusinesses that do well are built on foundations of trust and respect.

It takes a lot of guess work with local transportation out of the equation.  However, recently more and more we have noticed that UBER drivers started to play games when they don't like or appreciate the destination.  Some play it is dumb claiming they can't find the pickup location or they keep reassigning new pickup location when we just finished walking to the previous one they have requested.  Others are more direct and they just cancel the ride all together.

I think the developers should look into adding and option to mark drivers as Pet Friendly and allow users to select if they have a Pet traveling with them (with options like small pet in crate, large pet with blanket to sit on, small pet in bag, etc). drivers could charge more for those traveling with their pets- and users would happily pay that to not have to hassle with calling every driver after they request a ride to see if the driver will allow their dog or not. In both DC and NYC it was a hassle to try and find a big dog friendly driver- I had a big towel for my dog and he was great for our Uber drivers. And those that were dog friendly got a big cash tip. Uber and pet friendly drivers could be making quite a bit more on their base if they implemented something like this and if they upcharged for it.",

I should never have to walk to meet a driver if I am waiting in the correct, designated pick up spot. I understand that Uber credits my account back if I dispute the charge but the frustration of waiting for a new driver still remains. Especially if the price is higher than when originally requested. Sometimes I wait 20-30 minutes to reorder a ride because there will be surge prices. I don\u2019t just want my account credited, I want to make sure the drivers are held responsible for meeting passengers in the correct pick up spot and not just cancelling the ride because it is inconvenient for them to drive to the correct location.",

It makes absolutely zero sense. Especially in the winter, we\u2019re paying more to order an Uber for the conscience over public transportation, not so we can wait even long and walk over blocks that didn\u2019t even need to be walked!!

I\u2019m sure nobody wants to lose an appointment or a job interview just because your driver figured he didn\u2019t want to take you to your destination after 10 minutes of having confirmed it. If you are an Uber driver, you should just do what you are here to do, which is drive. If you don\u2019t want to go to a certain place, just don\u2019t accept the trip ffs.",

I\u2019ve been using this app over 6 months consecutively, and it\u2019s been worsening since then. The only good part without a hassle is the rewards tier system, which will occasionally get you a free ride if you\u2019re a frequent user of the app. Other than that, not so much worth it, I\u2019m likely to cancel my subscription and start looking at other apps to use for transport.",

Uber also states that you will be notified once a driver initiates the charge and this has never happened for me even though I get charged at the end. Uber has always been kind enough to refund my wait time charges but you have to go thru the process of filing a complaint and by then you\u2019ve already been ripped off.

    "review": "I was trying to use Uber for a morning flight to the Guadalajara airport. Apparently, drivers aren\u2019t informed of their destination until they arrive to pick someone up; two drivers in a row cancelled just as they were about to pull into the hotel. Someone working at the hotel got me a taxi and explained why the drivers kept canceling. The taxi was about 50% (about $8USD) more expensive, but I didn\u2019t end up missing my flight. There\u2019s no way to communicate with (much less rate) the driver once the trip is cancelled; both drivers had ratings of 4.9. The question is: why not just inform the drivers before they accept the ride & raise the fare until a trip out to the airport is worth someone\u2019s time? Isn\u2019t that the whole point of a variable-fare system? I\u2019ve never had this problem with Lyft \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if that platform works differently from the drivers\u2019 end. In the future, I\u2019ll just use Lyft where it\u2019s available & taxis where it\u2019s not. An unreliable ride-hail app is pretty worthless.",

Everything seemed to be working fine until I tried to order a ride, when I realized the family profile wouldn\u2019t show as a payment option.  I proceeded to try and register my credit card but found that after I put in the details and ordered the ride, I had to scan my card to verify it.  However because my card has the numbers on the back of it, it wouldn\u2019t scan and I couldn\u2019t order a ride anyways.  Later I reopened the app to try again and the family payment option was finally there.  So I selected it and pressed order, when it asked me to verify and scan a card on family payment, when I was not the owner of the account and hence didn\u2019t even own the payment method.  A lot of researching at this point brought me to the conclusion that, sorry, this massive organization can\u2019t bother to spend the tiniest bit of effort refining their app.",

The charges were obviously not mine because I\u2019ve never hailed rides in Russia. I contacted Uber about the several charges that were made through their automated email line but to my distress, they did not respond. My next step was to call the credit card company and have them suspend and recover the money charged to my account. That\u2019s when I assume that Uber did not like what I did. I was essentially kicked-out of using this s\u2022\u2022\u2022ty and disreputable app. Beware, Uber takes ZERO RESPONSIBILITY if your account gets hacked. Oh and by the way, if you are wondering if Uber ever answered back saying why I was blocked the answer is NO. Avoid this app, it\u2019s not worth going through all this trouble especially when it\u2019s a problem that pertains to their technical engineering. There\u2019s now plenty of other ride share apps around the world that are more reputable than Uber.",

I tip in cash every time, and if you came a long way I can see that. You\u2019d be getting a little more cash. It would also be nice to start my long day ahead of me, if some more drivers would be available in the mornings like a regular job so people can get to their regular jobs",

The Uber technical team *please* read this review and take this feedback into consideration in order to update your app. It is such an easy-to-understand feature and I have lost thousands of Uber credits because I cannot use them. As you know, Amex partners with Uber and issues monthly Uber credit for eligible cards. These Amex credits are supposed to expire at the end of the month in which they are issued. However, the current Uber app applies credit for rides/UberEats in a \u201cpredetermined\u201d order and applied Uber Cash (which will never expire) first, and Amex credit (which expire first) the last. This is a BUG that needs to be fixed. And I have lost thousands of credit due to expiration and being unable to use them towards Rides/UberEats orders. It\u2019s so stupid and companies like Uber cannot let this issue remain for so long. Stop using those outsourced support team who act like Bots!",

    "review": "Hello - I have been using Uber for over 4 years now and primarily been using for airport rides. Experience has been good until recently where I was charged almost $95 for a trip to the airport (scheduled ride) while the night before I was quoted $67-$77. Oddly enough Uber notified of the price change (and even that was only $87) approx 30 mins prior to the pick up and as I always do, I\u2019ve compared the fare with Lyft and noticed that they have kept the fare to under $67 for the same ride. The problem I have is the transparency and the fact that users are notified so late, users can\u2019t make the switch. Additionally, Uber\u2019s support has had many issues with lack of ability to speak to someone regarding the issue. Super disappointed and if it wasn\u2019t for AMEX platinum with Uber benefits, I would\u2019ve completely switched to Lyft at this point. Please provide transparency and ways to resolve customer issues.",

So we called Uber and driver was less than a mile away.. After 5 mins, we sent him text to ask if he is coming, and he said of course he is... Then we waited 20 mins but ne never showed up! and we took screenshot almost every minute to show that the driver is not moving even though he is 2mins away...\nAfter 20 mins ride was cancelled, we were charged $5 for cancellation, it felt very bad but finally we had evidence to bring this scam uber\u2019s attention...\nAnd after writing to support and sending all evidence; they said they cannot do anything and even though we tried to elevate, their customer service was the worst we ever seen... \nWe still have all the evidence about this UBER SCAM, until it becomes CLASS ACTION SUIT!!

The distance in pick up and drop off locations has increased the amount of walking and the algorithm is inefficient to the point where riders have complained multiple times that their driver is being directed in circles rather than having users be picked up in a more sensical location. If you\u2019re going to make someone walk a significant distance already, at least have them cross one more street to spare all of the riders another loop of traffic. Please fix algorithms. Additionally, the app does not allow you to pay for a ride partially with uber cash and credit card. So if you have insufficient funds in cash, it automatically defaults to card which leaves your residual cash in purgatory much like metrocards for the NYC MTA until you add more funds...

I have no idea what the cause is, whether it be drivers leaving due to poor compensation or a change to Uber\u2019s algorithms that pair riders with drivers, but it is no longer convenient to use.\n\nIn addition, uber has intentionally made it nearly impossible to contact customer service about issues. Unless something fits into their preselected categories, you can\u2019t do much about it (no email, live chat or phone number available). Using the in-app preset categories is not very useful even when you have a trip issue.",

I, or shall I say, people Uber as a better option to another alternative and that was missed in a big way. Uber should require the drivers to report whether they have an EZpass or now so the rider knows what they are getting and a way for the rider to choose if they want to accept the fees should the driver choose the toll route. In this case, I would\u2019ve selected that I would\u2019ve only got in the car with a rider who had an EZpass. The hour long commute I was trying to avoid so that I could get home my child so that my mom could catch her flight was even longer in the Uber. This was because he didn\u2019t have an EZPASS, so the ETA Uber provided me was completely misleading. What was said to be a 30 minute ride turned into an hour PLUS. This is a major gap that I hope Uber addresses. Also no customer service number for riders....if I could give a negative star I would.",

In the 3 years of using it I have NEVER recurved any discount codes at ALL despite my 4.95 rating (mind you I use this consistently around 12 times a week on average. I have also noticed that uber charges ME MORE compared to my friends or family from the exact same location as Uber\u2019s algorithm knows I have paid more in the past. Uber knows I am a loyal customer out of need but instead of lowering the prices by offering me discounts for my use they charge me more as they knows I will pay. I cannot wait until there are more independent companies offering ride-share come about because Uber clearly does not care about its customers despite many of them needing this service to either make a living or move around in their daily lives. Shame on you uber. This is why I now primarily use Lyft now. You have lost a loyal customer. I suggest more people do the same.",

    "review": "Having been an Uber customer for 6 years, you\u2019d think they would value your feedback - WRONG! I have had many bad experiences with this app and customer service and kept using it because it was slightly cheaper than the alternative. Well, yesterday I had a ride that almost made me miss my train because the Uber driver took many wrong turns and kept driving us in circles! Uber refused to take any responsibility, would not offer any discounts and I doubt they even spoke to the driver about his mistakes. Prior to that trip, I waited 10 minutes for an Uber pool just to have it cancel on me, forcing me to request a more expensive Uber X due to time constraints. When I tried to get someone to speak to on the phone, they informed me they don\u2019t even have a phone customer service line! Ridiculous that they are willing to lose their \u201cvalued\u201d customers over only a $14 charge. Spend an extra buck and use a ride service app that won\u2019t screw you over.",

It\u2019s also missing some key features. \n\n1) I needed to cancel a ride today because my driver was late and I missed the time by which I needed to be somewhere. No option to do this appeared in the menus until uber had already sent 4 drivers, one after the other, on the route. There is nothing in the help section re how to cancel a trip. There is no way to contact anyone at Uber for help. This is a major problem. Wasn\u2019t there supposed to be access to Uber support after those early incidents where people were attacked by their drivers? It\u2019s nowhere to be found. \n\n2) I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only business traveler to use Uber. Why is there no way to print a simple one-page receipt directly from the app?",

    "review": "Dear Uber Management,\n\nI used to be loyal to your company, but I have learned that Lyft rates for shared rides are more reasonable and affordable than your pool rates.\n\nLyft\u2019s shared ride rate, on one hand, is cheaper because the rider is sharing it with other riders\u2014totally fine with me\u2014without requiring riders to walk part of the way! Uber pool rate, on the other hand, is cheaper\u2014sometimes cheaper than Lyft\u2019s shared ride\u2014because the rider is sharing the ride with other riders and make all riders in a pool rate walk part of the trip! This is not okay with me and even with other riders I talked to who used to be your loyal customers! \n\nThe reason riders request for Uber or Lyft is because riders want convenience. Walking with bags of groceries on rainy days or freezing cold days is not convenient at all! With Uber pool ride rates, riders are required to walk part of the trip. I have no problem walking so long as I don\u2019t have bags of groceries with me and it is not raining or freezing cold! Why call Uber if it let\u2019s you walk halfway anyway?\n\nI\u2019m writing you this so you would somehow make some reasonable adjustments to your pool rates! Please don\u2019t let your riders walk to bring your rates down. Be competitive in a reasonable way!\n\nLastly, I apologize for switching to Lyft!\n\nRespectfully,\n\nJeanette Fabricante\nFormer loyal Uber rider",

Half the time their drivers do not arrive at the correct address but yet have smart remarks when they tell you you\u2019re wrong and you point out the correct door number! \nNot to mention their algorithm for wait time to be highly inaccurate. Last night i waited 14 mins (in 27 degrees) for an uber that was originally \u201c5 mins\u201d away.  Bcuz this was a shared ride, he arrived stating he\u2019s at the corner of Hamilton Pkwy and 92nd st- busy intersection. I inform him that I do not see him and request he turn his emergency lights so I can easily identify him in the dark.  What does he do- he hangs up on me. If you are 3-4 cars down, that is not the corner!! Uber needs to have a better vetting system when hiring drivers as these ppl are representing your brand and most (not all) are beyond awful. They give foreigners/minorities a bad name. This company needs a lot of work in the HR department- not cool!!",

For example, I order an Uber to my classes most Monday mornings and have taken to giving tips well over 30% to keep my rating up (because the lower my rating drops, the longer and I have to wait\u2014which inevitably makes me late for class) :/ I keep receiving occasional one star ratings even when I\u2019m on time, polite, and thank the driver. \n\nEven worse, my low rating score has made my wait times longer at night, when I need to leave an event with a safe ride. As a 20 year old who doesn\u2019t drink, waiting around late at night (outside sometimes!) for long periods of time is dangerous.

It was over an hour trip so the conversation about how terrible Uber is went on and on.  I paid him $40 cash to cover the tolls, then I tipped him again on the Uber receipt.  The next day I drove to the airport to pick up my daughter and realized the tolls were a fraction of what was on my receipt.  I was charged tolls going and returning which is fine but the driver complained he would be the one charged for them. Not only that but the tolls added by Uber, both ways, was more than I paid myself using my Mothers car.  I don\u2019t mind the charges by Uber on the receipt.

I\u2019ve had many situations where my driver was just downright terrible. Not only terrible at driving, but had nothing to say.. then they expect a 5 star rating. On top of that, they were driving either drunk or were high.

As time goes on, Pool passes (possibly even Pool pricing??) gets let and less reasonable to use as a daily tool. What started at 30% higher than standard commute prices is now closer to 130% higher (not factoring the unlimited rides you get on a monthly commuting pass in my city). \nThe new Express Pool is an okay offering to mitigate this expense, however the commuting benefits that partner with Uber can\u2019t apply to these rides. I understand the concept of supply and demand, but to adjust flat pricing that much AND still rely on surge pricing modifiers (to non pool users) seems unfair.",

    "review": "Tried Uber after being a Lyft user for a couple years. The Uber app looks a bit clunky, especially compared to Lyft\u2019s. A pop-up settings question partially covered a part of the screen I needed to see as I waited for my driver, and it wouldn\u2019t let me move or skip it until I answered all the questions about letting the driver track my actual location while picking me up. That would\u2019ve been better asked during setup and not while I was waiting for my driver. Speaking of that feature, I don\u2019t understand why my location would have to be \u201calways on\u201d instead of just while I\u2019m in the app. No thanks. \n\nMy biggest issue was the little fees and costs tacked on to what I was given as the price. If I was told it would be $20, why was it over $23 after everything was said and done? (Not including tip.) I don\u2019t like that. Give me the actual price! Never had that issue with Lyft."

    "review": "I used UBER multiple times for 2 days in NYC.   All in all the drivers we had were excellent!!!  The one downside is that the  app makes it very difficult to figure out exactly where the driver stops.  Several times the driver pickup direction was 2 blocks from the location I put in as my pick up spot.  You tell them exactly where you are \u201cIn front of Carnegie Hall\u201d  and they stop across the street or down the block. Okay for abled bodied - but not when there is an 85 y/o who can\u2019t cross the street.  Then to add insult to injury- I get hit with a $5.00 cancel fee because my 85 y/o can\u2019t cross the street fast enough to get to a location I did not ask for! !!   In city locations - drivers need to be more exact in following customer requests for pick ups."

    "review": "I schedule an uber for my sister so she had a ride while I was away. Since I was in a different country with a 6 hour time difference suddenly her scheduled pick up times were now 3:30pm instead of 9:30am....of course I got charged a fee because they went to go pick her up but she was not there. This was my first issue with uber my second issue was I requested a driver and I received the picture of the driver and he looked super creepy so I cancelled the trip a minute later and it said there was going to be a fee because the driver started heading toward me. I requested a second driver and he looked creepier then the first so I cancelled that driver and I got slapped with a $3.00 fee for cancelling twice in a row. I remember you use to be able to change drivers if you didn't like the person they paired you up with or they would show you your potential driver and then your confirmed the trip. Sorry uber but I will no longer be using you and your creepy looking drivers."

Immediately I tried to log into my account, and was told that my number was already being used on a different account. Meanwhile I had to put my credit card account on freeze and state fraud. I have emailed the Uber help several times, stating that I cannot log into my account. I was then emailed back by Uber stating to log in to my account to get help. Obviously I cannot ! My account is still being used with my name and now there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. This is due to the lack of security and care that Uber has for their customers. The experience was frustrating and scary. I am well aware that this does not happen to all the the users, but I would like is to be acknowledged by the Uber company, so that this lack of customer service doesn\u2019t happen to any one else.

After many failed attempts Uber didn\u2019t work. I could not book using my debit card, credit card, adding money to my Uber account using Uber Cash, not even Apple Pay worked. I sent Uber several emails asking how to fix the issue and after 4 hours of nothing working Apple sent me an email saying they were suspending my account, they gave no reason why, maybe except they were too lazy to look further into the issue. Well my sister is still stranded in Costa Rica with no ride, asking other hotel guest to book her an Uber while giving them CRC (Costa Rican currency). This is messed up and I\u2019m pretty sure you can\u2019t suspend my account for asking for help they also took my Uber cash of 25$ never refunded it and now I\u2019m out 25$ and no way to even book myself an Uber.

After 20 minutes of this I downloaded the Uber app on a whim  and provided my info. This took maybe 3 minutes.

However, after I noticed I was charged 83 cents extra for \u201cwait time\u201d? I really dont care about 83 cents, but the fact is I was waiting out front early for him to arrive and he had trouble finding my apartment. If anything you should be paying me for a wait time, it wasnt my fault. I tipped this man 5 bucs because I thought he deserved it. If I had seen this charge before that I wouldnt have tipped him just purely on principle. Again, 83 cents is pretty insignificant, but rest assured I will check my receipt ahead from now on and wont be tipping anyone when this type of charge shows up. Thank you and have a nice day."

They say they have arrived when they're still half a block away or worse when they miss a turn and are driving past me and are driving around the block charging me a waiting fee the whole time even though I'm always outside waiting. It's usually around 40-60 cents which quickly adds up when using multiple times a day. Also the drop off location I have set is on one street but the GPS has them dropping me off like a block away on another address that I guess is more convenient for the system. Uber needs to get it together. And rider beware check those receipts!!! I screenshot every time it says the driver has arrived until when they actually have to get my money back from Uber."

I messaged Uber about the incident and did not receive a response. My Uber privileges were actually revoked and I can\u2019t seem to log back in. The only logical conclusion I can come to is that I was kicked off Uber for being in drag. For the record, I\u2019ve been using Via ever since and have never experienced a problem. Sometimes, when I\u2019m traveling with more than one person it would be nice to have the luxury of using Uber since Via only offers low prices to those using 1 seat, but unfortunately, not all of the drivers at Uber are welcoming to drag queens and I\u2019m assuming LGBTQ, in general.

To my surprise upon returning from my trip; my personal card has hundreds of dollars of fraudulent transactions in addition to the charges on my company card. You are only able to communicate with Uber through the app. I have sent all of the requested information through the app and even been told that they don\u2019t see the transactions on their side. No resolution, but sorry we recommend that you contact your credit card company. Of course I did so, and yet they are telling my credit card company that the charges are valid even though they can not even verify the charges. Completely unacceptable. My credit card company shows the transactions as reoccurring meaning that they can continue to bill my card as the wish even if I change my account number. I am warning everyone now! BEWARE",

But the bad really outweighs the good here as I\u2019ve been done wrong by this app so many times. The most recent one is a flaw in their algorithm that detects the cost of your fare as streets are busy. More importantly the aspect of it that makes the price spike up as it is a holiday weekend or weekday. The price to go to work for me went from $25 to about $50 as it is memorial day weekend. However the problem begins when I noticed there weren\u2019t any cars nor was there any uber within 10 minutes, (i am fine with that because the cost is usually cheaper). But this time it was not cheaper due to this flaw in the system. Only because of the weekend name was there a price boost. They did not think to take it out mid-pandemic. I was forced to spend more money due to this while I should\u2019ve spend it on essential needs but thats fine ig. :(",

I realize, and immediately try to change the payment method to the credits I had that expired midnight that night. There was no option to change the payment method and the FAQ said to contact support which I did.

When I mentioned this to the driver, he ignored me. I had to sit soaked for 30 minutes and pay a $40 ride. When I brought this up to Uber support, they were \u201cgenerous\u201d enough to give me a $5 credit when I demanded a full refund on the entire ride. After 5 days of back on fourth with customer service, needless to say, I have deleted the app and will never be using them again...",

    "review": "Uber is simply unreliable outside of a few huge metro areas yet, surprisingly, even in big cities at non-peak hours it is often impossible to get a ride. I travel all over the country and found that even though Uber acts like it serves the area where you are requesting service, it frequently just leads you on and cannot provide a ride. DO NOT trust Uber for time-critical events like rides to the airport, without giving 3-4 times as much time as you think you need so that you can find alternative transportation when you get to the pickup screen and discover that you just wasted 20 minutes trying to get a ride that doesn\u2019t exist. The app really needs to state, up front the minute you put in your route, that it cannot provide a ride from your location instead of conning you into going through a process that makes it look like you can get a ride when, actually, you can\u2019t.",

The parking lot was congested, so drivers were having a tough time navigating through it.\n\nWhen Julia arrived, we first placed the baby in the car so we could then load our other stuff.  I told Julia I tried calling her twice to update my location, but her phone was off. Because I said this in a matter of fact tone, she asked if I wanted another driver.  I told her, no I was good.  She again asked and I said no.  She then said, You need to get another Uber.  I told her, \u201creally, you are kicking out a one year old, too?\u201d  Unbelievable.

Again all of this is the apps fault. In addition instead of the app pairing you with drivers who are willing to take ur pool and destination the dumb Uber app pairs you with drivers who don\u2019t want to go to that location or Uber pool. This all adds up to the Uber app being completely wrong when it gives a time estimate. E.g the latest I was supposed to arrive is 520pm today and I\u2019ve been in traffic for 40min and I\u2019ll actually arrive at 6-615. A whole hour later than the estimated time.

(And this is not just a problem with one driver, at the airport I had this happen to me no less than five times in a row. I finally had to take a different taxi service.) The application has no way to report unprofessional behavior by drivers if they cancel the trip, since you can only comment on drivers in the my trip section. Therefore, drivers who try to cheat do not have any repercussions, or incentive to behave better. This is a major flaw in the app, that leaves it open to abuse.

Then I\u2019m left scrambling and I\u2019m late for work. If you can not ensure the driver accepting those \u201creserved\u201c times will be accountable and reliable then get rid of the feature. This is the second time it\u2019s happened. The first was a reservation to catch a flight for a vacation. It\u2019s stressful and unacceptable because you ruin important moments for the customer and cause stress.  Again, get rid of the feature if the drivers can cancel with 5-10 min before arrival."

But, upon arrival, they charge you the sum even bigger than originally offered by their competitors. If this is not a scam, then I don't know what it is. Also, I don't understand how charging a person more than agreed can even be legal?...\n\nAlso, you can wait for a driver for 15 minutes and get a ride cancelled by the driver in the end. I once was late for my job interview because of such a high lever Unter service. Any compensation for your inconveniences? No. And if -you- cancel a driver, who is too far away from you (as you don't want to waste another 15 minutes and get a ride cancelled) - you get a penalty. Sooo incredibly fair.\n\nOnly use them as the very last backup plan. There are, thankfully, a lot of other, more trusty and reliable, alternatives."

    "review": "After years of using uber I thought I could rely on the service to provide me with an upfront price that I can rely on. Instead, because of \u201ctime\u201d and \u201cdistance\u201d in which the driver decided to take his own route rather than the app navigation I ended up getting charged almost twice what I expected to pay that was listed when I called the car. I contacted Uber for a price adjustment but Uber customer service gives me the same robotic answer. Sorry we \u201cunderstand\u201d, unfortunately we can\u2019t do anything. What terrible customer service.\n\nIf I can\u2019t rely on them to charge what they say they will and drivers can take whatever route they want and jack up the price I\u2019m not sure why I would want to use uber at all. I\u2019ve contacted them to delete my account. There are just too many other car service, rideshare and other transportation options in NYC to deal with this.\n\nEdit* Glad a developer can actually respond, but all I\u2019ve gotten from Uber so far is their \u201cunderstanding\u201d, but no action. If you want to know what you can do about it then maybe actually take some action about my issue.\n\nEdit #2* Following the developer\u2019s response I went to the website only to be led to the SAME EXACT help options that are in the app. Not helpful in the slightest. Useless action and bait and switch seem to be Uber\u2019s calling card now."

The request keeps \u201cexpiring\u201d only for us to get the ability to search for cars two seconds later it tells us \u201cNO CARS AVAILABLE\u201d.\n\nAs for quality of rides, it\u2019s a miracle if I see a car that doesn\u2019t look dingy, have stains, or have a horrific odor to it. They also always come later than is estimated by the app, usually 5-10 minutes later than the Uber app claims they will.\n\nI honestly regret having this waste of space on my phone, but I need it for garbage weather like this so I don\u2019t potentially die of a bad cold or hypothermia since unlike the drivers in their heated cars denying us rides, I don\u2019t have that when i\u2019m walking home in below freezing weather!

He was so nasty and mean talking to me during the poor conversation he had with me. He kept screaming at me the whole time. \nI feel that he purposely did this to easily earn the $5.00 cancellation charge. This is a very bad way of earning money. \nAfter that I scheduled another ride and the new driver came easily to my location in a few minutes with no delay and he was a very nice and delightful gentleman .\n\nI\u2019m very unhappy and disappointed with the first driver and feel I shouldn\u2019t get the $5.00 cancellation charge because it was the driver\u2019s fault for not doing his job. \nI request to be refunded the $5.00 since it was not my fault because the second driver found me fast and easy\nThank you,\n\nShana Movahedi"

Someday someone is going to get into a real accident and will 100% sue Uber over it.

I\u2019m tired of having to tell the driver this after I get in, and having them get annoyed if I don\u2019t want to go 15-20 miles over the speed limit, riding someone\u2019s bumper, and weaving in & out of lanes just to \u201cmake good time.\u201d"

However now that you guys have added the express pool, I love the thought but it needs to be tweaked. There\u2019s a lot of drivers and riders who do not understand the difference between the two. Many Uber drivers will still drop the express pool person off at their intended drop off point instead of the express route where they walk, and I find it\u2019s unfair when it\u2019s more than half of the price of a regular Uber pool rider. There\u2019s also times when Uber drivers have made me walk to a pickup destination and I never requested the express route, (so they should have picked me up from my actual pickup point). It\u2019s just the line between pool and express is constantly blurred and it\u2019s confusing for anyone who decides to ride Uber pool.",

Drivers are charging cleaning fees for nothing, the GPS is a real mess. They always charge you fees for nothing (for example a Uber driver that makes you wait 15 minutes, lost, that cancels last minute). Always have to contact the customer service and COMPLAIN to get the unfairly charged money back. Express pool and pool services\u2019 prices are important comparing to the service ($14 for 4 miles taking 45 minutes because the GPS keeps changing route and picking up the max people possible). For the last complaint I think this is made on purpose so users are upset and take the uber X service, 3 times more expensive. I don\u2019t know I\u2019m just very disappointed with the company.",

I waited a minute and looked again, only to see they'd gone up a few dollars. Exhausted and ready to be home, I agreed to the ridiculously high price (which worked out to roughly $3.50/minute) before it got any higher. \n\nTwo minutes after agreeing to the fare, my partner looked up the same route and found it was $105 cheaper now than it had been just a moment before. I was dumbfounded. \n\nWhen my driver picked me up, he made a comment about the drive time being nearly two hours. I looked up the traffic and told him it was more like 45-50 minutes, which it was. He said he'd encountered some glitches with the app and relied mostly on me for directions. The ride was fine. \n\nI emailed back and forth with customer service--never the same person twice--and never received a straight answer as to whether it was normal for prices to fluctuate by $100 in a matter of minutes. The only thing they were clear about was that I agreed to the fare and I should be more careful next time. I don't know if the app was, in fact, suffering glitches or if wild price fluctuations are common, but I felt taken advantage of both as a first time user and as a weary traveler.",

The driver arrival times are rarely, if ever accurate.  On my last trip, the Uber app said approx driver arrival time was 6 mins, then it went to 4, it was over 40 minutes until the driver actually arrived.  Good strategy for Uber, bad for me.  I could have easily grabbed a taxi, and made it home in the amount of time I ended up waiting - for close to the same price.  This situation is becoming more and more common.  And, to make matters worse, UberEats is a disaster.  The food is rarely prepared correctly, often cold, and Uber provides no support whatsoever.",

The drivers themselves need to take some responsibility too, and actually look at the pickup spot and think how to get there efficiently.  \n\nRoutes aren\u2019t bad, generally, but occasionally new riders will get added that require significant backtracking. \n\nOn the shared rides the estimates of pickup and drop off time are off by 50% at times.  Example , at 6:10a Uber says it will connect you to a driver within 5 minutes, with a predicted pickup at 6:20a and an arrival time of 6:30a and no later than 6:38a.  This is typical behavior.  Unfortunately, also typical is that it doesn\u2019t connect you with a driver for close to 10 minutes and by then the driver is still more than 10 minutes away, or worse they are very close by but 3-4m walk so you have to rush out to not miss them. . So they notify you there will be a \u201cslight delay\u201d and ETA becomes 6:46a.

Anywhere you want to travel in Brooklyn and queens and you\u2019re charged more per mile than the city despite the surcharge not applying to those boroughs. Whether you\u2019re going to a minority neighborhood or coming from one, they charge more. \n\nThis is disgusting, you\u2019re better off ordering a taxi cab service. Taxi charged me $25 for a Ride from Manhattan to queens that Uber calculated to be $45. DO NOT get this app if you live in a minority neighborhood at all, absolutely ridiculous.",

A lot of alternatives can be found and better. \n\nWhat i think made Uber drop to 1 star:\n\n1) they never answer to customers and if they answer it\u2019s always the same reply. (Even this comment will be replied by a common answer: please write to us on help section... check it by yourself). \n2) drivers can steal your money by making unnecessary rounds around your location making the wait time climb easily. And this is your fault Uber says: \u201ccompensation for making driver wait\u201d. \n3) Uber never verifies versions of stories and never refund you more than one time even if you\u2019re 100% right. \n4) Uber starts charging you even if the car still have another ride finish with another customer inside! Yes you read it right. \n5) Uber app is considering your driver arrived even if he\u2019s at 300 meters away and needs to take a u turn or another direction to reach you. \n6) Uber disabled the possibility to write to them through the app. \n7) Uber removed many options in the complaints. So they are telling you that you only have the right to complain about some features and most of them already are a dead end solution!\n\nOther companies are much better and have at least a hotline (free) to call in case of emergency.",

No answer after four texts. Finally, the app updated to say that driver was 8 minutes away. Yeah! But, then the driver cancelled. Really? After waiting over 30 minutes the driver cancelled with no explanation, no text, nothing! So, we were rerouted for a different driver. He was fabulous. But, I think Uber should reimburse me for waiting an hour and having a rude driver that cancelled with NO explanation. That\u2019s crappy service.

Second off, I got a $145 gift card for Uber and all my rides Uber takes money from both the gift card and my bank account. So they double charge me. And every time I have an issue there\u2019s no way to really reach them. Non of my problems have ever been resolved. Don\u2019t use Uber.

The biggest issue I have with this is that you won\u2019t know where exactly you will be picked up until a ride is confirmed OR dropped off until you\u2019re in the ride (the location updates multiple times during) so there\u2019s no transparency. I understand it\u2019s to make the driver\u2019s route more efficient, but 6 blocks can be a lot for someone to walk especially if they\u2019re injured or if the person doesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s a safe location."

I just got on a ride after waiting 15 mins (uber pool) when initially the estimated time was 5, as i watched the driver come to me via a slow, spiraling route on the app. This was also after another driver cancelling on me. and it is not an isolated incident, it\u2019s happened to me a couple of times in the past week, and worse if attempting to use uber express (I tried it once and two or three drivers cancelled on me in a row). It is annoying because if you decide to cancel after a long wait you have to pay a fee, while if driver cancels on you it is as if nothing happens. new updates now have a countdown clock while connecting to drivers, showing an intention to bring in some level of transparency, but the actual experience is quite the contrary."

I don\u2019t have an Uber account.  So I call all the numbers google can provide me with.  There is NO phone support for riders only drivers, so I chose trying to sign up as a driver so I could speak to a human as this is a very sensitive situation, they tell me they cannot help, there is no phone support for riders.  After about 20 minutes if waiting to speak to a supervisor I hang up because I find this unacceptable, go empty my account and report my card stolen since they wouldn\u2019t even look into it.  Obviously they don\u2019t care if someone is attempting to use stolen cards as long as they\u2019re getting money, wait until Monday on a Friday evening for someone to get back in touch with you."

But if I opt to use those rewards, it sets the Uber cash as my default payment and the very next time I use the app, punishes me for it by not allowing me to order a car until I reup ubercash. So then I have to reselect my default card and reorder a car. \n\nThis takes seconds but my new price is always a little bit higher. My frustration is high bc I tend to order a car and then not even see the blocker bc I put my phone in my pocket, waiting for the haptic feedback to alert me when I am matched with a driver. Which means sometimes I'm out the door and headed to the elevator before I see the ubercash block and have to reorder a car.  Stop doing this!"

Where the driver drives past me, leaves me and doesn\u2019t pick up calls. Then the app tells me my ride has began. The driver never cancelled the trip as I texted and called him many times. How can you began my ride if you never picked me up. Then have the nerve to charge me $20 instead of the $10 my ride was. I couldn\u2019t get another Uber because the driver wouldn\u2019t cancel the ride. I ended up having to use a friends account to get a cab. Just ridiculous. I wish Uber had a customer service number. Who wants to constantly text them. Smh. Overall I do enjoy Uber but I wish we could avoid issues like the ones I\u2019ve been having recently."

Nothing to do with the driver, but the application. My ride was a total of 7 blocks from my pick up point to final destination. Your application make me walk 4 out of the 7 blocks. If I knew ahead of time that that was going to happen, I would of chose to walk the 7 blocks instead or get a cab for door to door service and the price would have been about the same.

I did out of desperation and guess what that said everyone was busy and to try again in a few minutes \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Not being able to take a chance on being late to our flight we had to drive my vehicle and pay per day at the airport (which was only $5 more than if we got a one way Uber).

I\u2019m constantly getting notified to try again later because there\u2019s no drivers in my area. \n\nCustomer service is really bad and needs to improve. Why doesn\u2019t Uber have an email that customers can contact?? Every time I have a problem I have to report it on the App & get a reply from some random person & whatever they say goes. You can\u2019t even reply back to them. Not only that, but they let anyone become an Uber driver.

It\u2019s extremely inconveniencing. For instance, yesterday I had a dentist appointment at 4:30, so I ordered the Uber around 4:06 to ensure that I got picked up in time for my appointment, my Uber had another person he was currently dropping off so I had to wait around 23 minutes which means I WAS PICKED UP AT 4:29, one minute before my appointment, which caused me to be late. And it\u2019s frustrating to say the very least so I firmly believe drivers should only be allowed to pick up people if the customer will only have to wait 10-5 minutes for the driver.

In my defense i didn\u2019t eat the whole day so it was just a mist of alcohol and stomach acid so it came out like a sneeze. As anybody would, the driver freaked out and kicked me out of the car 3/4 of a mile from my destination. All of that is reasonable but they still charged me the entire fee as if he dropped me off at my destination, charged $150 to my debit card for a cleaning fee, and luckily I was literally 50ft from my destination when an officer stopped me because I had been stumbling for almost a mile walking back and gave me a verbal warning for public intoxication because I was so close to my home. So my only grievance is, if you\u2019re gonna kick me out, don\u2019t charge me the whole fee as if you brought me home. Stop the meter where I got out. Because I almost got a PI for a ride I paid for, to take me home. AND still had to pay $150 to clean."

She is not familiar that on  the katy toll road she can drive in the HOV lane as long as there are two passengers in the vehicle so she would not get charged any toll. This is common place on a lot of houston tolls or simply HOV lanes especially the interstate I10 which goes through houston as these HOV lanes are far less busy.

    "review": "Recently spent a long weekend in France during the transportation strike.  Our only options for mobility were walking and Uber... so Uber we went.  Unfortunately, Uber kept double dipping into my debit account which I set up with limited funds and because it kept double dipping (funds hold & charge, instead of releasing the hold), my bank identified it as fraud.  Sucked, now I had to deal with a fraud (not fraud) issue.  Secondly, because of the strike drivers would accept the ride then get to our pick up location... determine whether they wanted to continue (based on traffic) and then cancel the ride.  We literally had 1 driver see us and not stop and cancel the ride at the end of the street, at which point we were charged 6 euros.  \ud83e\udd2c  It took us an hour and 4 drivers before one showed up, by why was I being charged when the driver cancelled the trip (never even stopped to talk to us)."

I ordered my Uber at evergreen park high school to pick up my son, their main entrance is 100th and Kedzie .  Immediately after I ordered it and my card was charged it told me to walk to 94th and Kedzie and arrive in 4 minutes.  These are 6 long blocks , not the short ones going east and west .  So even for me who is a walker it would take me 10 or 15 minutes and I would be half way home.  So I immediate messaged the driver there must be an error , the pool system says that I \u201cmay have a short walk\u201d which 80% of the time there is none and the other 20% it\u2019s maybe a block at the most .  So the driver who I think her name was Berniece called me and when I explained the situation and that it\u2019s about a 15 minute walk she yelled \u201cthen you shouldn\u2019t have selected pool\u201d and then hung up"

I went back in, got the address from the hostess and entered the street address number, the street name, and the app filled in the city and zip.

    "review": "Uber is the worst transportation service because the drivers will cancel on you if you don\u2019t carry cash (something foreigners are usually instructed not to do). They call you first to see which payment method you\u2019re using and they will cancel if it isn\u2019t cash.\nThe drivers are often rude (in MENA) with dirty cars and little respect for your safety. I\u2019ve had for report them many times for driving in a way which made me feel unsafe. This may not seem like such a big deal, but living in Saudi Arabia (where car accidents are the number one cause of early death) it\u2019s a huge issue.\nThe only redeeming factor is that Uber is often cheaper than its competitor in MENA, Careem. However, I will not be using Uber again until driver ratings are damaged because of their ability to cancel on customers who don\u2019t pay cash. Bye bye, Uber! It was nice knowing you."

The drivers are very rude (most of them), and one time I was listening to a video on my phone quietly and the Uber driver said \u201cyou better turn that off\u201d in such a rude manner that I wanted to slap her in the face and tell her that I was the customer and she is choosing to work this job. I am NEVER going to use Uber again and I will tell all my friends and family of my experiences. Uber should do something more about Uber\u2019s canceling their drive because one time I had 3 drivers cancel on me and I was late to my appointment. So thank you for nothing uber.\n\nby the way the driver that I was talking about had a very bad attitude to drivers in a school zone. Her name is ashley and her license plate is: 8EXV067",

Over 50% of Lyft drivers are female, and in general they have more prestigious background checks for their drivers. Basically, it\u2019s harder to become a Lyft driver than an Uber driver (which is a good thing!). \nThird of all, there is no solid way to contact uber support. They don\u2019t offer a support number, where you could just voice complaints or ask for help. \n\nThis app has been getting on my last nerves and I\u2019m glad to say that I\u2019m finally switching to a safer, more affordable, and secure option.

It\u2019s too often just as slow as public transportation and very often delayed past projections. Additionally, it seems like even when you\u2019re running later than the ETA, they still add new riders to the trip. I\u2019ll continue using it here and there but I\u2019m done with Uber as an integral part of my commute.\n\nUpdate: my driver just made half my trip (out of the way to pick up other drivers) and told me to leave the car saying he wouldn\u2019t drop me off at my destination because it was out of the way of where he wanted to go. However, this is going up to three stars since almost immediately after reporting Uber refunded my trip and even gave me some credit towards my next trip\n\nA few weeks ago my rating would\u2019ve been 5 stars.

When he finally found it he stopped 10 yards away from me even though I was standing in the street waving my phone. I noted that the car smelled of cigarette smoke. For the rest of our 10 minute ride he proceeded to complain about riders that smoke and bring the the smell into the car (I don\u2019t smoke). But what really makes me angry is that after the ride I got my charge for it which included a fee for waiting time??? Does Uber charge \u201cwaiting time\u201d fees for drivers that can\u2019t find an address? I then spent 30 minutes trying to figure out how to dispute the charge and found there was only this. If you want my business contact me to make this right!!!",

I would recommend this app for both frequent and infrequent travelers because it is very convenient and simple to use. Typically For every 10 apps I try, only 1 will remain on my phone, this is one that remains on my phone and my family likes it just as much as I do. Normally I don\u2019t fill out reviews but I have had great success with the app and Uber, so I feel confident giving the two thumbs up on this app along with the services.",

Two days later I got a fraudulent charge to my credit card from Uber for 30$. The driver charged me with a cleaning fee. Stating I created the mess. No contact was made no email. In trying to resolve this issue there are no phone numbers to call Uber, only email. Their customer service is awful. They do not investigate it and just keep stating the driver reported and there is a charge. If they would review the picture and talk to the driver they would realize there is no way one person could make that much mess in the entire back seat of a car. Either it was already there or the drivers previous ride did it. I am very dissatisfied and disappointed is how Uber is dealing with this.",

Uber also deliberately removed the option to allow people to give them location information only while using the app, to force people into giving their location information at all times.\n\nApple had to specifically modify how location tracking worked in iOS 11 to prevent Uber (and other greedy, dishonest companies) from forcing users into allowing Uber to track their location at all times. Uber knew about this upcoming change for MONTHS in advance but chose to keep tracking users\u2019 location (even when they weren\u2019t using the app) until the last moment, when they were forced to stop.\n\nNow Uber is trying to cover up their dishonest, disgusting, and shameful behavior by pretending that it was they who magnanimously decided to give users a choice how their location information is used. That\u2019s just more dishonest, disgusting, and shameful behavior, and it\u2019s hardly the actions of a company that has \u201cturned over a new leaf\u201d.",

Sometimes I just take regular cabs cause they won\u2019t appreciate the gesture. I do not want to feel stressed when it comes to see my profile so what\u2019s wrong in here? You guys ask us to treat them nice which is ok but have you ever really check on the drivers?? Do they actually give the ratings were supposed to get? Kind of sad."

A few years ago drivers would arrive before the estimated ETA. Now constantly late drivers and drivers that shouldn\u2019t even be on the road are now increasingly the norm. It also is obvious that driver are using multiple apps to make money at the same time because their estimated time of arrival will go up rather than down. In other words drivers are using Lyft to get fares then as they finish rides on the other app they are accepting rides on Uber. So when Uber says 10min it might be 10min or it might be 25min. Which understandably is hard to detect but it still makes a big difference when you are trying to plan a night out or a ride to the airport. I miss the Uber of yesteryear."

It\u2019s hard for me to recommend an app that fails at its primary function during all daylight hours. I spent forty-five minutes trying to find a ride to work this morning, and every single ride (UberX, Comfort, all of them) canceled after about 5 minutes. I ended up getting my boss to drive me, instead of the ride-share app. Two stars because when it does work, it\u2019s great. It\u2019s gotten me to and from many late-night parties, though it did fail me even last time I was trying to get to a party. I think I\u2019ll be shifting to Lyft unless I can start getting better short-distance service because as it stands, Uber has failed me too many times to be trusted."

So the initial ride was canceled and we booked a second ride.\nThen, later that evening we had two other drivers cancel on us, leaving us stranded in the rain for a half an hour. Which we were never compensated for. So technical issues aside, I fail to grasp the inherent equality of such an agreement. I\u2019m not talking about perfectly worded legal contracts that need to be interpreted by professionals - just basic straightforward, commonsense social contract stuff.\nUPDATE: Uber refunded the ride.

Uber was my go-to choice since it was cheaper than Lyft(at the time) due to their Rewards program offering a discounted price on a set route which is actually really handy!\n\nHowever Uber then came out with Uber Pass which is similar to Lyft\u2019s Lyft Pink in that you pay a flat fee every month to get a discount. I suppose in an effort to incentivize their rewards users to subscribe to this new plan, they got rid of the Set Route Price Protection and replaced it with a much less appealing point boost.\n\nThere\u2019s several problems here. The Uber Pass discount is much smaller than in comparison to the Price Protection discount. I went from paying roughly $25 a day to around $40 just to get to-and-from work. The Uber Pass\u2019 discount is just not incentivizing enough. Its even more expensive than Lyft\u2019s similar service which is $5 cheaper and gives 15% off rides.\n\nThe other issue is that the rewards just are not that good. Realistically, frequent users are going to choose to get a 15% discount on their Uber ride but that still isn\u2019t reliable for frequent riders.\n\nThey either need to revert the Price Protection to its previous state or make Uber Pass more worth it.",

    "review": "I was a loyal Uber user for years. But the moment something goes wrong, Uber\u2019s support team is so quick to blame drivers. I had to navigate through so many menus denying over and over their assertions that my issue must have been my driver\u2019s fault. After giving me a $5 gift card in an attempt to get me hooked on prepaying for their service, I gave up. I downloaded Lyft and GrubHub as replacements for Uber\u2019s services. WOW the selection of food is SO much better on GrubHub. Lyft drivers seem so much happier, the car got there faster, AND it was cheaper. I\u2019ver never had my opinion change so quickly. Lyft and GrubHubs apps are nicer and less soulless looking. I no longer feel awkward when ordering a car or food with friends who judged me for using Uber. Uber really is as unfriendly and greedy as people say they are. The alternatives are also just better!",

    "review": "I am a frequent user of the Uber app but now have decided to plan my days without it. \nAfter their initiative to allow Uber drivers to charge more for their rides (up to 5x), it has me seeing a $20 charge for what was always a $6-7 ride. Definitely not worth that just to go to work. Already made other arrangements regarding that. \nBecause my rides are short, drivers tend to not pick me up. Ones that do eventually agree to pick me up eventually cancel wasting more of my time. This is the same for when I make scheduled rides as well. \nMy average experience with Uber is waiting 30-40min just to commute to work. Fortunately, work was empathetic of my situation and gave me no trouble but this is an issue that needs to be resolved immediately. Uber is greedy.\nEdit: \nI also want to add that this price gouging is unacceptable; especially, during these times of a pandemic crisis. It\u2019s understandable that drivers need be payed; however, on the riders\u2019 perspective they can\u2019t afford to pay 4x their usual fare. This driver-rider mutual relationship should be equally treated the same. Quite a contradiction. \nAt the time of this review, Lyft has been reasonable with price and pickup time. I recommend Lyft FORNOW. Hopefully, Lyft learns from Uber\u2019s mistakes.",

I asked multiple times to speak to an Uber agent on the phone, and they instead insist I use email to log the issue. Frustrated, I then spent 30 minutes doing my best to put the entire issue into one email (at their request), and I got the same copy-paste responses from their team.

Well Uber switched the way they charge you giving you an estimate of 8-12 dollars and more than likely it\u2019ll be the higher cost. They over price their rides. Then canceling rides is a nightmare... they charge you for canceling a ride that may be 10 mins away. Furthermore, their service is garbage and if you write a complaint the customer service is even worst. There are many more complaints that I can make; however, I\u2019ll stop here... as I have great news. Lol I switch to Lyft and they have rides at a quicker and cheaper rate. I also thought previously Lyft sucked because it was an unfair assumption I had made; however, their service is rather prompt, clean and respectful. I can have my headphones in jam out and enjoy the ride. Lastly, I am happy with the ride since their prices are cheaper, most of the time!",

I should not get charged a \u201csmall fee\u201d or \u201cfive dollars\u201d once the third driver has cancelled on me and I want to switch to Lyft. (Which I have been doing a lot of lately).

I\u2019m not getting any luck AT ALL so far I\u2019ve lost $48 in two months and I haven\u2019t used the service. It\u2019s practically impossible to speak to a human everything is over the phone and the Internet so there\u2019s no human connection. I don\u2019t have 24+ dollars to donate to a service that I don\u2019t use anymore I need help!! I want to stop my service I will no longer use Uber I\u2019d rather go to Lyft. This is huge inconvenience for me. Uber was quick to stop my service  they thought I was another customer who gave a driver a hard time.I couldn\u2019t get a ride until a number I wasn\u2019t able to call back (Uber)called me to dispute a situation I had nothing to do with. I just want to stop the service you all are stealing from me at this point and I\u2019m sick of it and I want my money back."

Shouldn\u2019t I receive that time back or should I wait for someone to give me that time back? \n\nYeah, I ranted and so what?

    "review": "Uber is mostly useful but their app takes a long time to start upon an iPhone 6 with no other apps running.  It also drains a new iPhone battery amazingly fast so once I recognize that my ride has come I stop running the app immediately.  Also, be aware that pick up locations are not always accurate.  Finally, using pooled rides in some areas may require a long walk to a pickup location.  In my case it was over a half mile through a neighborhood that felt unsafe so I cancelled the ride and left the area but had to pay a penalty fee.\n\nIn summary, I\u2019m glad to have the Uber option in many situations. However, their technology needs considerable work before I would call it a refined product."

The messages are signed by a person with a name but they clearly are not reading the emails and are responding generically. They have regularly charged me more than the quoted price, often charging me the Uber X price when I called an Uber pool. Once I had a driver in a pool take a fellow passenger to run an errand- he dropped him off at a store and let him buy something and then come back into the car before he took him to the final destination. I was late because of this. When I complained to Uber I got a generic response and was told they couldn\u2019t do anything about the fare. These are just some examples of their terrible customer service. I\u2019ve also regularly been hit on by the drivers- something that has never happened to me when I take Juno."

I was very late for a show because the uber pool I booked was 11 minutes away and then when I tried to cancel as soon as I saw they wanted to charge me far to much (which Lyft often doesn\u2019t do) so I thought okay whatever I\u2019ll take the ride and then of course it took much longer than the ap said and was wildly inconvenient and infuriating. I wanted to get out and just take a cab, when I realized how late I\u2019d be, but they would have charged me even more. My driver was perfectly fine but the way the app functions for pools is infuriating. My ride was a waste of money because I didn\u2019t even get to my destination as I was so late they wouldn\u2019t let me in. That\u2019s never happened with lyft.

As a regular rider, there are very few discounts offered by Uber for customer loyalty or those who are frequent riders. While there are perks to this service there is also stiff competition in this arena. As such, Uber will have to do better to retain riders. What makes me rate this app or service so low is the poor customer service that I\u2019ve received when presenting an issue with my ride. The agents are fairly passive and dismissive of the concern and offer little to no resolve which isn\u2019t good. Hopefully Uber will take this feedback to heart and act on it by providing better all around service and some sort of benefit or concessions for those who are frequent riders spending a certain amount"

Then when you ask about the delay the driver says they were completing a trip nearby. I believe the drivers and this is an app fault not notifying the riders. Also, there used to be a clear difference on screen and price wise between Uber, uber pool, and uber pool express. I HATE that they combined Uber pool and Uber pool express. You have to understand that it's very confusing in a big city to \"walk around the block\" and be picked up somewhere new with Uber pool express. I wish they'd kept Uber pool without forcing express down our throats. Uber pool is now almost the same price as normal Uber :/"

Uber refused to reimburse me for the trip or look into the issue seriously, insisting it was just an unpleasant odor, instead of investigating the issue. I\u2019m willing to forgive a lot when it comes to driving in NYC- I take the subway and taxis regularly, but I draw the line at health hazards.

Is it too much for Uber to require that if you drive for them then your vehicle should be \u201cclean\u201d?  \n\nI don\u2019t want to malign Ezekiel but this was the tip of the iceberg. I do hope that Uber takes the necessary steps to insure that all their drivers take the time to ensure that their passengers are not sitting in a dirty vehicle.",

I do not have twitter to reach out to the twitter handle provided for feedback nor do I believe tweeting the airport is an effective means for gathering feedback.

Furthermore I don\u2019t mind the walking option, I think it\u2019s great that we get a choice to save money to walk a bit, but if they\u2019re going to offer that then they need to work on the DISTANCE! You can\u2019t have someone walk 13 minutes when the driver they connect you to is only 4 minutes away. That just doesn\u2019t make any sense.

My account has randomly been disabled multiple times. Figuring out how to contact Uber about it is like finding a needle in a haystack. I have been stuck in an airport a few times and forced to use more expensive taxis (tonight included) because Uber decided it was the right time to disable my account again or randomly not allow credit card payments. Now I\u2019m trying to use another email address and phone number I own to set another account up, and whenever I click to agree to the TOC and privacy policy it just redirects me back to the previous screen. Every time. \n\nThe idea of Uber is great. But from a customer service and functional standpoint it just fails too often.",

Problem is that with too many updates and no info other than that riders are left in the dark about the new features. My biggest problem with the new update is that I am no longer prompted at the end of a ride to rate my driver, or tip them. I have to go into my ride history, find the ride, then do it. I have a feeling a lot of riders will not go through that process resulting in less driver tips which, when a driver goes out of their way for someone or provides any service, even a cell phone charger, the customer\u2019s best way to show appreciation is to tip since the driver can match the tip with a the ride, but if you only rate them, they have no way to tell who rated what and why.",

I believe, that even when committed to you, if they find a better deal close by, they loose the commitment and take it and leave you \"holding a bag of air\"\nThe fish hunter\nOn Friday the 22nd, I ask for a ride to the airport and the driver confirmed at about 5:35am, he was 14 minutes away, then he picked up another passenger, after he had committed to come pick me up, I had an international flight, I could not cancel the trip and on the phone he told me he had another passenger , I declined to ride with anybody else due to security reasons in Bogota.\nHe would not cancel my trip, so I could not ask for another Uber ride, then after 25 precious minutes waisted, at 6:00 am, I had to call a taxi,\nThe second time that I was screwed up by Uber drivers and the app\nThey are ilegal and not approved in Colombia, and if the drivers do not commit as supposed to, this will spread. \nOn top of it,they charged my credit card as it was my fault!!\nThe Fish Hunter",

The extra $5 in fare isn\u2019t worth it to me. 2) I\u2019ve had 3 straight fares where after 5-10 minutes of waiting for an Uber, the driver cancels on me. And then I\u2019m stuck waiting an extra 10-20 minutes for a ride. Is there any penalty to a driver?

Dent your car, scratch it. \n\nSometimes you make $3 a ride, $1 of those dollars has to be spent on gas so you net $2 total. You can make $30 a day or $150 a day. \n\nWeekends are the best, it\u2019s not even worth it driving in the day as small towns are flooded with Ubers. \n\nOnly do rides with a surge and avoid picking up people who are 8 minutes away. Stick with 5 minutes or less to avoid wasting gas. You\u2019ve been warned. \n\nThis will save you months of headaches. \n\nOnly do this until you find a real job. It gets you through hard times.",

    "review": "I used to only use Uber but they have really let the quality of their product go downhill. Whenever I need a ride, Lyft is always significantly cheaper. Also, I have tried the Uber electric scooters (JUMP scooters) and about half of the ones I tried did not work at all but I still got charged for using them. I tried to use the JUMP electric bikes too, and it would not lock. I had to call Uber and get it resolved and it was extremely frustrating. I got charged for an extra 14 minutes of use and I was late to my meeting because of the poor quality of Uber\u2019s products. I highly recommend Lyft instead, they were much more responsive with any quality concerns and they care more about their customers and drivers. Don\u2019t waste your money on Uber, they\u2019ve proven time and time again that they don\u2019t value our time or money. Poor quality!"

The uber app decided to place me on the other side of the blocked street of the parade, unable to be reached by my uber driver. I waited as each driver cancelled due to the fact that i was placed in a unreachable position given to me by the app. After a horrendous 45 mins of waiting, I gave up. I could have cancelled these trips but ultimately, it would result in me getting charged with a cancellation fee for waiting 45 mins. Ultimately, i am extremely displeased with the fact that i was placed in an unreachable position and that i had to wait 45 minutes for one ride, that is absolutely unacceptable. I can back this up with screenshots that i took but unfortunately this platform wont allow me to share it. Please feel free to contact me for further information."

    "review": "I\u2019ve been using Uber since it started and average about 1-2 rides a week. I consider myself a solid return customer, but lately I\u2019ve been having serious issues with drivers cancelling on me during peak times when they get surge notifications. \n\nJust this evening I had three drivers cancel on me when I had locked in a good rate just prior to a big surge at the airport. Turning a $35 ride into $70 and changing a 7min wait into 35min. Because of this I ended up taking a Lyft. \n\nIf Uber wants to keep their customers they need to prevent drivers from cancelling on riders due to better surge rates. The driver app should prevent drivers from getting surge notifications until after their current ride is over. Until they address this issue I\u2019ll be using Lyft more regularly. If there\u2019s a penalty for riders cancelling rides it should be the same for drivers!",

I was extremely impressed with the kindness of the drivers and helping me to load my stuffs into the trunk, a small service I almost couldn\u2019t find from Lyft drivers! But I really hope that this app could support landscape mode. I know this app is for more like \u201con-the-go\u201d usage, but it would be nice to have that since I use my iPad in landscape, especially for typing convenience. This also applies to Uber Eats, as I would use the app on the desk rather than carrying around. Besides that, I enjoy using Uber around city areas where there are limits for driving my own car such as parking. Keep it up!!",

Before this was scheduled I also accidentally booked another ride when I was only trying to schedule this one because the app does not make it clear when in the process you are able to schedule a ride.

We were stuck for an hour+ in an area of Portland OR  where we could not get Uber no matter what I tried. Uber phone assist was of NO help. It was very irritating to listen to the robot answers of Uber employees who answered the phone. Eventually thanks to taxi availability we made it to the airport. Please give this issue a serious consideration. A satisfactory solution to this problem will be extremely helpful to many who find themselves in such situations.",

I had taken an Uber that morning so I guess it had tacked me all day. \n\nUber is a great app and the concept is great, but this recent change where I always need to share my location is ridiculous. \n\nNow I say the app can never track my location. Just a bit too creepy to think it might be tracking me. So if I want to use it I need to find a nearby address and type that in as my location. This is a pain. So I've found myself using the Gett app more. \n\nGett's cab drivers want nothing more than to make Uber disappear. Continuing to creep its users out is a quick way for Uber to give Gett more of its business and make their cabbies stronger, who will stomp Uber out in city councils around the world. \n\nSo, Uber, just stop tracking me please. I want you to win but you're making it hard.",

Not to mention you never know if a section is blocked due to a ceremony... Update where it's needed and where it counts the most."

But I still was charged for this wait time $7 extra.\nAlso, the new congestion surchage in NY WHAT?... I don\u2019t even think this applies to my trip? If I knew all these fees where going to be added I wouldn\u2019t have probably chosen Uber. I been using Uber for years and this is the first time I get soooo many random charges. \nPlease refund me for this ride (or at least give a real solution to the $80+ bill I got from you) and it would be nice if you guys start showing the actual cost of the rides in NY, so US the users can make better deductions.

The reason I'm giving the app 3 stars is because once in a while, I (or a friend) will request a pick-up, wait for over 5 minutes, have a new driver assigned 3 times, and I'm not able to cancel the trip without being charged the cancellation fee.  If we end up getting the driver changed that many times and have to wait longer each time a new driver is assigned, there shouldn't be a cancellation fee.

It tells you 4 minutes, then 8 minutes, then another 5 and before you know it, you\u2019ve waited 15 minutes for a car that was supposed to be there in 4 mins. In addition, realize that when you give an arrival estimate to riders, they expect it to be roughly around that time (which used to be the case). Whenever I get in a car and a driver uses Waze to navigate, rather than Google maps or the Uber app itself, it adds about 10-20 minutes. Every time.

I looked at my phone to check his progress and he had CANCELLED. This has called me all kinds of trouble since my car keys are in the bag, so I can\u2019t drive my car home from airport (an hour away) when I arrive at my home airport! I don\u2019t think so will trust UBer in the future, but will just stick with a taxi SUPER FRUSTRATING!",

He asks for my address and I never hear from him again. Was I worried, Yes. Last time I used Uber was over a year ago in Washington DC.\nFinally after attempting to call the first driver and sending multiple texts someone from Uber notifies me that the first driver cancelled and another driver is coming. So why did I buy the most expensive ride? Not really sure how Uber works because of my limited experience. Javier is wonderful and made a stressful situation into a pleasant experience.",

I often book right before I head out the door because it says 2 minutes and I don\u2019t want the driver waiting but the time increases, they never seem to know the area so it takes longer, and they can\u2019t follow directions when you try to call and help them out.

So, I told him to cancel the ride instead because if I will be the one to cancel, there is a cancelation charge on my part. He said yes but I think he doesn\u2019t know how to do it either. So, I cancel it because I cannot book another ride if I dont. I was able to order another ride but I was already late for my bus ride going to Las Vegas.

Emailing is annoying & you never speak to the same person twice. Which means, the new person answering has to read all previous messages, which they don\u2019t, & that\u2019s stupid. VIPs need to be treated as such. If I\u2019m taking an Uber everyday to work, I should get a discount where rare riders don\u2019t. Drivers need to be held accountable for accepting a ride & then not picking that person up or calling you before pickup & then cancelling your ride bcuz they don\u2019t wanna go that direction. Uber needs to stop being greedy with surge pricing. A usual $7-$10 ride, during surge pricing, shouldn\u2019t be $59-$104, that\u2019s absolutely ridiculous.",

It doesn't recognizes what side of the street you're, what's the precise address, etc  (it may cost you a lot of time trying to reach the driver and self explaining a new route). \n\nSecondly, and not less important, the uber drivers. Wow. I don't know what kind of selective process it uses but let's face it. It doesn't work, at least in Brazil. Uber's team is made by non drivers that: 1) don't  drive properly, 2) don't  know how to follow a GPS (partly Uber's fault), 3) don't know how to deal with customers.\n\nLast but not least, as mentioned above there's a high chance of having your trip delayed, and for the first time in the history of customer services, you, customer will pay for their malfunction. How? Being charged small amount of cash when their driver cancel or even quits trying to get to your location. Not just cash but, as said before, cost you a lot of time embarrassing you to you're bosses, friends, dates etc.\n\nUnfortunately in Brazil we don't have a good public transportation because I'm a daily user but craving to stop using, its such a pity. \n\nBest regards,",

Maybe if he tried booking a ride he would discover his company\u2019s faults. I don\u2019t believe fault lies with the drivers I believe it to be in the company\u2019s lack of navigational assistance to their drivers. Also Uber\u2019s App Is incredibly impossible to use.

Then a few nights before that I had gotten off work and was outside waiting for 1 hour while the app said she was 5 mins away that entire hour. Then she ended up cancelling the trip and I got charged for the Uber driver cancelling the trip. That exact same thing happened the next night except I waited 30 mins before I jus cancelled it bc I was tired and needed to get home. I haven\u2019t gotten my money back from either of those times. When I have good service I tip the drivers, but the past 5 times I rode with Uber I had bad experiences so now time to try Lyft."

This app told me this morning the driver would arrive in 1 min and yet the driver just drove away because his phone was dead. I ended up wait for 10 mins because uber would not let me cancel my ride to request a closer car! instead the driver had to turn back from far far away to pick me up. This is just one of two instances this month uber has made terrible routes and terrible eta estimation that caused me big troubles. But when you finally navigate through the useless Help section and get to support, they\u2019ll just \u201cnoted your feedback.\u201d The app does not care about user experience anymore."

I\u2019ve been taking Lyft more recently because then you don\u2019t have to deal with walking ahem RUNNING to your pickup place. They never give you enough time to make it there unless you jaywalk, which has been really dangerous. Also being a lady, I don\u2019t feel the safest walking around at night! They also put people who are NOT on the way to your destination at all, there\u2019s been times I\u2019ve had to backtrack, adding ten minutes. They also say when you book that you\u2019ll arrive at a certain time, but then they\u2019ll add someone to your trip and the time will change. The uber pool used to be much better, now it\u2019s awful. Using Lyft from now on."

Basically all seemed to be ok until the moment I was supposed to be picked up and then nobody showed up at the location. I waited and waited and finally had to drive my own car to the airport as I was running to catch a flight. The part that was disappointing other that the no show up from any Uber driver was that there was no way to either ask or call anybody to ask about the issue or possible options for me to still catch another Uber. So, having some sort of way to communicate the issue when it\u2019s happening could be great. Thanks"

Plus as riders, we would get terrible ratings if we made a driver wait 7-10 min EVERYTIME. Stop ripping off your customers..because you just lose business to other services (Black Cabs and private drivers) in this city..because I don\u2019t use you for the cost saving..it was service and speed..but that is definitely not the case anymore."

We are traveling in Las Vegas and on 3 separate occasions the driver canceled our trip because we were not at the pick up where the location service told the driver. It looks like I was charged on three separate times by the drivers because they refused to follow my manual directions (we were at the Cosmopolitan but location service said we were next door at the Bellagio). Still not sure why the drivers could not drive 100 feet and pick us up. We had to walk a few miles back to our hotel because Uber was so unreliable. Looks like Lyft has a bonus offer to switch so I will be moving on from Uber after 4 years."

I frequently have my drivers tell me Uber has routed them through a closed off area...if the app isn\u2019t able to update given closures, it shouldn\u2019t be an application.

I told dispatch where we were and why my message had not been read or a call made to me. She said she would alert the driver who arrived shortly after.  Mystery solved when we found the driver did not speak English nor, I presume did not read it.  To add insult, Uber added a $2.97 wait time charge to the bill!  Why would you even employ a driver without rudimentary English in an English speaking country??"

In more than 3 occasions I have been charged more, for issues of the uber app, for drivers starting my trip and not even picking me up, cancellation fees due to driver\u2019s fault, driver making a detour that added 30min to my ride, and the list goes on. I have been trying to contact them and they reply this generic message that they will apply me the refund, but they hadn\u2019t done it. This is not only scam, but a straight lie to my own face. They have stolen more than $30, and even though the amount is little (I take uber on daily basis at least 2 times per day), what is really annoying is how drivers and uber take advantage of it and how they NEVER take responsibility. Since I can\u2019t contact them to actually resolve my issue, I am going to contact my bank and law enforcement authorities."

I get home and get an email for a $33 charge. In fact, they were gracious enough to show that i had received $11 off! You\u2019ve gotta be kidding me. How does $20 turn into $44 with $11 off.

When I went to rate him the app went blank and I couldn\u2019t get back in in the airport.  When I landed I tried to update it and write a review about how great he was and HIGHLY recommend his services.  I was able to rate him a 5 star rating but was not able to write a review.  There needs to be a place to do this.  Very frustrating since I had to go edit my original rating but I had never oven one. So no telling what was there.   Would love to be contacted by Uber to make sure he gets a great review."

The application constantly glitches and sometime takes 20 minutes just to find a ride.\n\nIn addition, the pool service is just plain horrendous. Pools are often picked up in the opposite direction of where you\u2019re going which delays rides more than 30 minutes. Pick up locations also never work out. You have to walk 5-10 minutes just to get to your ride.

Both flights were leaving from JFK which is less than 15mins by car from my apartment. \n\nI watched as drivers accepted to pick me up and cancelled one after the other. This went on for about 20 minutes and continued for another 25 minutes after I called and waited for a traditional taxi service. \n\n***Heres my issue with Uber - instead of Uber having it in their algorithm to ask me if I would like to cancel after a driver cancels on me, the app automatically begins searching for a new driver. ***\n\nAfter getting fed up of this cycle and calling my local taxi service, I had to pay $11 to the final Uber driver for inconveniencing him. No the value wasn't much but it did add insult to injury and I after my two terrible experiences I will never use Uber again nor recommend their services to anyone. \n\nLook, if you're accustomed to a certain level of service and professionalism - just contact a professional driving service.",

So next time I will be checking Lyft first. That was a bullbleep.",

For example,  \"S Street\" comes before or after \"R\" street and it is not short for \"Southern Street\", as my driver was just insisting.  \n\nDo you have any maps? Could your drivers  please be expected to learn basic landmarks (e.g. Pentagon, \"Senate\", \"White House\") - basic orientation would help drivers a lot. \n\nFinally - not sure why -- but Uber does not seem to use mainstream/normal navigation apps.

Was told that there was nothing they could do based off their \u201crefund policy\u201d, even after I\u2019ve confirmed that that funds were taken shut my ride was not received. They simply stated that next time \u201cmake sure to verify things\u201d next time, and to set up extra security measures. I asked for a credit at least for the funds that were taken; and they stated again, per their refund policy, there\u2019s nothing that can be done. \n\nCustomer service was absolutely no help at all.",

But I selected uber over Lyft for shorter waiting time this morning and willing to pay extra $5. \n\nBut it was a very unpleasant ride because of this rude driver, Carlos . Meeting spot was at NE of pacific. However streets were dark and couldn\u2019t figure out which side of street was pacific and west vs east of the street. I had to check three or four cars with blinkers on to locate right one. It must took me about 2 mins. I apologized immediately as I got in the car and told him I had hard time to figure out NE and pacific. The driver, Carlos, was soooooo rude, he yelled out several times \u201cwhich part don\u2019t you understand? This is easy and West, this is north and south!!!!\u201d Really? A visitor to LA should know which side of the road is east and west in dark?\n\nI\u2019m kind and patient with drivers, but this guy should NOT be an uber driver at all with this kind attitudes. I paid $5 extra over Lyft for shorter waiting time and I get this kind driver ????? Again, he should not be in service sector! He Gives negative reputation to Uber. Fyi, I will go back to Lyft for better service and less fees.",

And this is specifically set for those who use Uber frequently, cause they sometimes have no choice but to choose Uber when it comes to commuting. And they will do price game where they will charge higher surcharges for those regulars who really need rides for commutes. Ridiculous. \n\nWhen you pool, they will even charge more for the extra distanced that caused by other pool riders. And they will never adjust prices for you but instead they will give you the lamest excuses to end claims. \n\nAlso when you complain these, you will get the worst explanation ever from customer service who will just reply back with what Uber trained agents with manuals. Basically they don\u2019t care even for those regular customers, all they think is how they an rib off even extra pennies from customers. \n\nThey are getting worse and worse but they don\u2019t see any necessities to improve, because apparently there isn\u2019t lots of car services like this, Uber is dominantly invading this industry that they think people will come back to Uber regardless. Their business practices are getting poorer and I will try not choose to ride Uber.",

That conversation was on April 1, now it\u2019s May.\n\nThey also failed to provide a uber cash purchase history, and that is the key reason that I think this whole thing is a scam, basically they can charge whatever they want and say whatever they want without providing solid proof of my uber cash purchase history and the cash balance history on their end.\n\nI\u2019ve been used uber since 2013 and am a platinum member and I am very disappointed in uber.",

The app was incredibly slow and didn't allow me to sign up, kept going back to different steps in the sign up process, so I signed up on my laptop. I signed in on the app after creating my account on my laptop and tried to update certain information and other things like my profile picture. App wouldn't let me, told me I needed to contact support to do so. I then proceeded to add my payment method. The app wouldn't add my card saying I was already using my card on the account. I went back and checked and it wasn't on there. Left the app and tried to see if I could add it on the website and I couldn't. I went back to the app, it had logged me out, so I tried to sign in once more. Told me my account was suspended. Incredibly irritating, I am just going to use Lyft.",

We were shown the first level of vehicle. Cost being 20 but knew it would end up being $23 or so. After we arrived home we realized we had been overcharged. I realized Uber has said we were charged correctly. I realize that. But that\u2019s NOT the case. It is not what we agreed to. I would never ask or agree for a $60 vehicle. We didn\u2019t need it because there was only two of us. It makes no sense. This was our first experience using Uber and now we are rethinking ever using it again. They have the worst customer service ever. You can\u2019t talk to anybody. They don\u2019t listen. All they do is tell you that you\u2019re wrong. Horrible customer service!",

I can\u2019t get into my Uber app via my iPad and this driver basically decided to keep my phone and there is nothing I can do to report them.

Every Uber driver I\u2019ve had, has provided me with a spectacular experience, and it\u2019s a much better experience than taking a cab... however, my only complaint is that their GPS system seems to either send the driver to the wrong address when picking me up and/or makes the driver take the longest route possible to get to my location. To me, this hasn\u2019t been a big enough inconvenience to give the app less than 4 stars because my driver is able to text me when s/he isn\u2019t able to find my location. Uber can use some improvements, but I would still highly recommend!"

But Friday night was the last straw and I want to be heard. I booked a ride at a bar across from the beach in SD and the ride was originally $27. The driver charged me a cleaning fee for sand that I did not even bring to the car, we weren\u2019t even on the beach, we came out of a building and now charged me $70 and apparently the driver sent pictures of sand all over the seats. This is unfair and wrong because we weren\u2019t even covered in sand or dirt, we came out of a bar. He planted that mess and now I feel taken advantage of my card being charged over the amount and now I\u2019m going to dispute it with my bank, I will never trust this app again and no one will listen on contact email so here\u2019s my complaint.",

Nine out of 10 drivers are courteous and clean and make good conversation. Or stay quiet if you're not in the mood. The prices are a little high and it's encouraging me to figure out other ways to get around, as well as just not drink out at bars. But still it's a priceless app , just to be able to get a ride most places you are. I've used it in a rural areas in Connecticut as well as New York City.",

I\u2019ve been late to work twice now because of wait times - and I ordered the Uber 30 minutes in advance for a five minute ride. The last time, my driver made me wait 15+ minutes because they were sitting in a Dunkin Donuts drive through, only to cancel on me and leave me late for work. I wouldn\u2019t be so upset about this if Uber had better customer service, but it\u2019s extremely difficult to get unconventional issues like this one resolved, because they have no support phone line or email. I\u2019ll be taking a taxi next time - the extra fair is far less than the opportunity cost of Uber\u2019s poor service.",

And every time I have to cancel it charges me $5 saying the driver is already in their way.... Even if I cancel within 20 seconds after I realise their GPS has screwed up again. \n\nIt NEVER gets the arrival location right, I'm trying to follow where the car is on the map and it's constantly sliding around not showing me where the driver is waiting. I can't waste this kind of time and money when Uber is neither cheaper nor more efficient than Lyft. \n\nBonus issue, there's no way to leave a text note about the trip OR leave feedback on the app. You can only pick from a few of their pre-defined issues, or say nothing at all. \n\nHopefully someday you can improve but you've cost me too much time and money already so I'm going back to Lyft.

What it did show me is that Uber takes its customers riding experiences seriously. Uber rocks."

As a customer, you would be stuck with your $5 fee and wasted time and stress. You will be late for work with no one to complain to, because you can only reach support if your driver is attempting to kill you! By all means, don\u2019t call 911 if that\u2019s the case, call the most unhelpful and lacking support app in the world instead...\n\nFurther, DO NOT EVER rely on the ETA given by the app. I have never, not once, arrived at work when the app has suggested I would.

What I was surprised about was that the driver called me after close to an hour, and he had the wrong street name and was in completely wrong location. I think that he had difficulty communicating with me in English. When I informed him where I was at which was some 10 miles from where he was at the time he told me that he did not want to come and pick me up. Then I was further surprised to receive a charge of $9.09 for a cancelled trip charge. I filed a complaint and received a message that I would receive a credit for that charge.

The fate used to be $7.78 but now on average it is $20+ for a 1 minute drive! \n\nTaking an Uber to Walmart used to be between $10-$11 but now is more than twice that. I spent approximately $40 just to go get baby formula. It took 17 minutes for the Uber to pick me up to go and 22 minutes to pick me up to come home. \n\nIt\u2019s scary. So many people depend on Uber. Uber needs to stop punishing the customer (common sense) because they (the company) won\u2019t fix the problems they are having. I won\u2019t be using Uber much longer. I think the company believes that most people are so dependent on them that they will pay triple the price and wait 3-4 times as long but nope. There are independent drivers now, people are using Taxi\u2019s again and taking Lyft. \n\nI understand that the money has to come from somewhere but the customer shouldn\u2019t have to pay triple the amount.

This has cause me to injure my ankle because instead of being able to eat a uber to school I had to make a two and a half hour walk early in the morning and late at night!!! I\u2019m giving this a couple more days and that\u2019s it or else we are gonna have a serious problem"

Shouldnt the pickups be for people that are coming my way? Why do I need to go pick them up when its out of my way and I got on the ride first? Why if Im already heading down South, we need to turn around going North to pick someone else up? And please dont tell me I can always request the UberX, I know that. I just find it ridiculous and unnecesary to make my ride longer than it should be because you dont want to fix the way the pickups work. Stop screwing your customers with stupid things like this.

Half hour later he was still not on a pick up. He was driving around trying to find me and I was by the main road. When he passed me second time I waved to him and he didn\u2019t stop. Finally he stopped closed by and I was able to approach him. After short conversation he refused to give me a ride. I was heading to the airport and I almost missed my flight. I end up driving myself to the airport parking lot and I left my car there for 10 days. I am going to pay fortune for that when I come back,  but I didn\u2019t have any other option. At the end Uber charged me 5.00 for cancellation which I haven\u2019t done it. Your driver did."

But in my experience on multiple occasions, the feature makes you walk a block in either direction, only to have the driver pass your destination to pick you up and then turn around. If your destination is along a major road as well, the same thing happens on the drop off. You are dropped a block or more from your destination, only to watch the driver leave you and drive past it. What\u2019s the gimmick here? Nothing about this situation makes anything more efficient for anyone!"

If I hadn\u2019t done that he would\u2019ve drove away and I would\u2019ve been charged a fee for not being there when he was. Hence this made me clock in a few minutes late at work. I thought the whole point of Uber was supposed to be fast/reliable transportation at our fingertips.   It makes no sense paying for a service like this at all. I paid money to be picked up at my exact spot and drop off at my exact location. FIX THIS!!!"

As a broke college student, this amount pained me but I still took it. After arriving to my destination, a full $120 was charged to my account. After an hour of trying to find anything I could do to negate this as I knew that was my grocery money for the month, I was able to request a refund somewhere in the app. They gave me a dollar back. Thanks, Uber. Maybe try Lyft instead.",

When I checked the app, the price had changed from 3 euros to 13 euros. When I didn\u2019t confirm, I saw Armondo\u2019s car coming down the hill. He said he didn\u2019t speak English and said our location was the airport. I said no, & showed him a printed copy of the address. He said no he didn\u2019t know where it was & kept trying to get me to re-input the address. I said no. He said bad app & insisted I confirm. When we  started talking about getting out & taking a cab, he finally saw the light took off driving. It took him about 2 minutes to get to our location on a busy main Porto street. I think this guy scams foreigners so steer clear of Armondo! He is the kind of driver that gives Uber a bad name.",

I asked the doorman where it was. He told me to cross the street and wait at the corner. I did just that. Then a few minutes later I got a note from the Uber driver telling me he was at another block an he cancelled my trip. Then I walked back to where I was staying and called for another Uber ride, this time paying $20 more. Then to add insult, I was charged some $6.00 for cancelling the trip.

Now sometimes I\u2019m late for work because they pick so many people up and some of these people also take more than 2 minutes which is frustrating. Uberexpress came along and made things worse. I\u2019m paying A LOT to walk blocks away from my pickup address to blocks away from my destination for the same price that was once the UberX AND Uberpool. What\u2019s next? How much more do I have to walk or how many more people does Uber have to pick up for me to get to my destination? I might as well take the bus.",

Basically you get double charged every time you request a ride. Sometimes even triple charged if you or a driver cancels the ride. The authorization holds are \u201ctemporary\u201d but take 5-9 business days to clear. That is not temporary. Even after the ride ends and the driver is paid the authorization holds still stay on card or account. The customer service for riders is poor.",

After the ride has concluded, the amount shown on the driver's device is the actual amount to be paid. The fare can differ due to changes in routes, traffic conditions or time taken.

Wouldn\u2019t it be possible to organize these things in a better way? Drivers who cancel at the last minute should be fined and customers should be given enough time to think about options. Unless someone believes that we are here to serve Uber drivers and not the other way \u2018round!\nThank you,\nMG."

Now I have had so many issues with buying a ride pass because the ride pass DOES NOT work. For some reason my ride pass will not apply to any of my rides, I end up paying the regular price, Which I have reported before and they basically told me thats normal. So I end up wasting $25 and on top of that not saving any money. \nI spend way too much money to not be offered some way to save money. Something besides spending $1,000+ for a $5 reward in return or a ride pass that saves me nothing."

As of late, the gps is less real-time tracking and more a disappearing and reappearing act that makes predicting when I should step out into the cold, dark night much less precise\n\nCreate a reporting/cancellation system for scammers. The rise of scammers who accept a ride only to stay still or drive in the opposite direction, simply to reap cancellation fees, is despicable. What about a reporting feature where customers who get ripped off under this system get refunded and the driver penalized?"

The customer agent repeats the same generic message over and over telling me to use another credit card when I already tried over 3 cards. Also, what's with the credits moving to Uber cash?

Recently my pick up address has been giving them directions to go to the other side of town when the address clearly states N.W., the GPS is sending them to a S.W. address. It\u2019s starting to irk me as I spend more time trying to make sure the driver doesn\u2019t get lost and now I\u2019m having to text them directions so that they don\u2019t follow the directions given to them by the Uber app. \nThis app is great to have but I have to have lots of patience at the same time.",

They charged me twice for a trip I took only once and when my card denied the second transaction Uber charged me a higher rate. When I tried to fix it with them they were just trying to charge my card again a 3rd time & again my card denied the transaction because I already paid for my tip in the beginning of the ride. Sad to say but Uber wouldn\u2019t let me use my account anymore because of it.

My prior experience with uber was when uber was promoted as a true cashless ride service where cash tipping was discouraged and certainly not an in app feature. Since enabling tipping, and my recent experience, I can only assume your drivers are making their ratings based off how much you tip which is absurd; quick research online seems to suggest needing to tip $5 for 5 stars! I can\u2019t even describe how crazy that is because if I\u2019m tipping $5 on every ride, I may as well just pay standard taxi fare...\n\nRating should be solely on you as a rider; tipping should truly be optional and have no bearing on you rating.",

Earlier this week, I was late to work after calling an uber an hour and a half before my shift started. I live 10 minutes away from where I work. I live in a big city where there are usually no problems calling ubers. It took my uber 45 minutes to get to my house when the app said he was only 10 minutes away. I literally never complain about stuff like this, but I paid a lot for that ride and was still late to work, even though I ordered it long enough ahead of time that I wouldn\u2019t have been late at all. I\u2019m an avid uber user and have never had such a horrible experience.",

The prices started going up by a bunch and the rides were getting so much longer for short distances it would be quicker by train. then now you have to pay extra to be picked up at your location and dropped off at your location ? Isn't being picked up where needed and dropped off where needed is how taxi services work?! why do I need to walk several blocks to get picked up to be dropped off a couple blocks from my location unless I pay more ? That\u2019s ridiculous it already takes about 40 minutes to get to a place that should only be a 15 minute drive! It\u2019s getting to be too much",

It took 40 minutes, since customer service is not available for such issues. Uber needs to take responsibility for driver cancellations especially where the driver makes no effort to contact the rider to ask for locations when they can\u2019t find their way. Uber needs to set the price, keep it the same if it was a lower fare when the drivers decide to cancel. They should be able create some the of algorithm or rule in the system to do this. Put the responsibility and ownership on the drivers to do better and not penalize the customers for their mistakes.",

I manually typed in both addresses for pick up and drop off because I don\u2019t trust the GPS. The driver never made it over to my location. Next thing I know, my ride is cancelled. They didn\u2019t call me or anything to acknowledge they couldn\u2019t find me. Lyft at least texts you when your ride is at the pickup so you can call them and sort out the issue. I was standing in the same spot where I entered the address, freezing for 10 minutes. So then I ordered another Uber pool and again, stood for another 10 minutes waiting. \n\nThe app claims I will get my $5 back towards another ride. But how do I know if that will even be applied since I usually have a discount from good rating??? How about you credit my account back because at this point I would rather use Lyft. At least there\u2019s a way to contact them...\n\nAgain, I\u2019m sorry for the rating because I do like using Uber and Lyft, but I\u2019m sure my rating was impacted for the \u201cmissed\u201d ride that I didn\u2019t even miss!",

At least give the passenger a few route options before requesting their trip. The route is already mapped out when accepting the trip but 2 minutes into the trip the route changes to a longer drive time. This happens way to often. A common Point A to Point B destination should always be a straight line first...not with your app though. No help in the app to make Uber aware of the GPS problems only options to complain about what the driver did or didn\u2019t do. No accountability on Uber\u2019s part.

I\u2019m watching the app and see he is one minute from me and then instead of turning right like he should\u2019ve, he turns left. Then I see him turn into a driveway and just sit there. So I call him. I ask him why he is sitting there because he turned the wrong way. He apologizes and backs out of the driveway and sees me standing on the side of the road and picks me up immediately. But when I looked at my bill, I\u2019m charged a waiting fee. He didn\u2019t wait for me. He was at the wrong location, but somehow that is my fault?!? Really?!? I\u2019d really like to know why that is.",

I was late for work today because Uber decided to pair me with someone whose destination was clear across town on the opposite side of where I was heading... mind you I was the first fare and it\u2019s completely inconvenient.. my driver had to fight through unnecessary traffic in order to get to my side of town.. come on Uber you guys need to get the pooling together and not inconvenience riders like this.. pair riders who are going the same way.. just makes more sense!",

Since they just updated the app with the new express thing where you have to walk to a certain spot to get picked up which is kind of okay but at the same time when they show you those points you have to meet, sometimes it\u2019ll be far away from where you are located and that is so annoying. Even if you try to change it to not have that express line, it cost more which is kind of stupid to me.

They don\u2019t care about you at all, you can ONLY talk to someone through email (they will NOT call you or let you call them) and they don\u2019t have any sort of escalation specialist for any reason.

My final straw With Uber was a couple days ago. The Uber driver drove off with ALL of my sisters clothes and Uber has been giving me the run around for the past 2 days when I asked them to contact the driver. I contacted the driver multiple times the night she left with my sisters clothes and she blocked my number. Also there needs to be a way to talk to people who work with Uber OVER THE PHONE and not just through text because they respond when they feel like it. My sister still doesn\u2019t have her clothes and when she gets them back I will be deleting Uber off of my phone.",

We tried to contact the number he called me on right away. This did not work. After numerous attempts to contact Uber - through app which did not work then through email we sent - we finally got ahold of the driver.\n3.

On top of that, I have to wait several business days in order to receive my funds back into my account. Whenever you used to have a problem, you could call customer support and they would handle the problem immediately. They\u2019ve completely eliminated the customer service number so that they\u2019re no longer able to be held to the same standard of accountability for issues with drivers. Automated support through the app only goes so far and it\u2019s a joke. Here\u2019s some advice for Uber: Get customer service back up or someone else will, and take you out in the process.",

The original driver had another number originally attached to their account which they still are not responding to... \n\nIdk why they don\u2019t pay attention to new members and on high volume days. I was literally stranded outside a store which had closed until I realized their car was not moving on the map and I scrambled for other arrangements.

That seems like a good idea in a way but, it's frustrating when the Uber driver expects you to run across the street to meet them. It's not taken into consideration how dangerous it is to do that in most places and the fact that it's illegal. If I go ahead and go to stop light, it takes more than the 2 minutes they wait. It'll be easier on the customer if that option was removed. And why are they allowed to pick up more people than the car fits? I had a lady shove 3 of us in her back seat when it was only made for 2 passengers. Luckily we all fit because we were all less than average signed people.",

I believe when I bought my new phone (new number) and downloaded the uber app on this new phone, somehow my payment method was blacklisted from uber and my uber app priviliges revoked.  Keep in mind there is really is no help or support after you been flagged by this. I am extremely dissapointed the by the way their tech team gave me vague response and lack of resolution to my situation.  If this is the way they treat faithful customers I want no part of building their business.",

The rides are now filled with confusion and anger, making the overall experience more stressful than anything. \n\nPlease consider reverting back to the old system and returning to the app we could depend on.",

Well I added it to the app and couldn\u2019t use it because every time I\u2019d try and get a pick up, and use it, it tried to use my old credit card on the app and you can\u2019t change it!!it wouldn\u2019t use the Uber cash even tho the tab was clearly on. Costumer service was horrible. They did nothing. Still trying to take the card off. This is just the main issue out of many.

I don\u2019t need to know who, but I always tip 20% and give my drivers 5 stars, plus I\u2019m always at the meet up point so what the heck??",

Was surprised by too many things:\n\n1. Incorrect time estimate: whether on a corporate ride or pooling personally Uber never returned money back after their scheduled time was more than the time they showed originally. And required to lodge a complain. Lazy riders like me would always loose money on cancellations for fairly valid reasons\n\n2. Ride tier change: Jumped me from pool to uberx automatically. Charged me twice the amount and on contacting the support services, they treat you like a brain dead zombie and try to tell you in essence that their estimate matches and that uberx are expensive\n\n3. Just overall mistrust that I developed through too many incidents. Gave a feeling that there are keyboard warriors sitting reading complaints without customer empathy.

Uber is one of the LEAST helpful things of all time during this PANDEMIC. not saying make the prices LOWER but in a time of crisis where most ppl are living off unemployment and barely making it now bc the only job they had is gone, have to pay twice as much. these prices are SAD. What if i needed to get tested for the VIRUS, i\u2019d have to come out my pocket hella money just to assure my health! thats WILD! definitely not using uber for a while. Lyft wins this time.",

He drove very slowly, cars were honking their horns, and it soon became clear to us that the man should not be sitting behind the wheel.

When we told him he had missed the exits he blamed the GPS. We ended getting to Fort Lee in a round about way. \n\nWe told him, after trying to explain to him where to turn into our street, that he should not be driving, that it is obvious that he is a danger to himself and to his passengers.\n\nIt is because of this very scary ride that we gave him 1 star only.\n\nOur experience with Uber drivers had been very good, we hope Ibrahim is not a sign of what is to come.",

If driver is still on a trip, i should not be penalized. There were 3 available drivers today and I got the driver who was still carrying somebody. \n\nIn my issue above, how about if you add 5 minutes to take into account that the driver is still on another trip?\n\nI see Uber offering lots of ways for drivers to give feedback, but not for us passengers (footing the final bill!!), you should fix that.\nAfter reading other reviews, people have the same complaint I do and they are all told write to us and we can connect. You know who we are, how about if you treat us like the paying customers we are? Why are you charging is if we cancel a trip because the driver is not showing up.

Before the update, dropping me off to the door step of my location costed the same amount that it not does to drop me off 5 mins away from it. The customer support has also declined over time. Uber used to be very helpful, now the service seems useless.",

I told her I was not and that I was waiting outside the coffee bean where I had ordered the Uber. She told me okay but that she was going to go to the Marriott anyways to use the restroom. I would have cancelled and ordered another driver who was actually ready to Uber but a notification alerted me that I would be charged $5 to cancel. The ride itself cost less than $5 so regrettably I didn\u2019t cancel. I was eventually picked up almost 30 minutes later. Terrible service. If a driver starts off 3 minutes away, you should be allowed to cancel for free after waiting 20 minutes.",

When I tried to put in the correct address, I got the \u201csomething is wrong, wait a few minutes and try again\u201d message. So I ordered the car to the incorrect address, planning to update the pickup address when a car was found. Trying to do that, the map kept reverting to the incorrect address.  Finally I talked with the driver who barely spoke English and did not know major intersections when I tried to tell him how to find me.\nToday I was charged for the cancelled call.\nMy complaints:\n1. The Uber GPS incorrectly pinned an address\n2. The incorrect address could not be amended by the rider\n3. The driver did not speak English and I do not speak Korean\n4. The driver was inadequately trained about the area he was trying to serve\n5. As I have clear instructions to the driver, he made no effort to leave the incorrect address",

This all happened in Nashville & I realize the downtown area was very crowded as well as the traffic was very busy. These underlying circumstances should not be obstacles in preventing good service.

But if you need any form of assistance I wish you luck. I have never left a review this bad on anything but after a week of back and forth with no resolution and barely getting a response I have lost all faith in Uber. On to trying Lyft",

Over all I\u2019m bummed, but Lyft has been redeeming things with their in-borough pooling fares and estimated drop off times are much more accurate, which is a focus Uber should take notes on especially with the construction of the L train in Brooklyn and more people needing ride services.",

The majority of my last 10 trips, the Uber app displayed a pick-up time, then adjusted it up - often by 2-3 times.  So, it would show 4 minutes when a driver accepted, then jump to 10-12 minutes.  I have had this happen in Boston, Nee York and San Francisco.  I don\u2019t want to blast the drivers, as it\u2019s rarely their fault, but many of these rides should not even be accepted as I could tell right away the drivers are much further away than what\u2019s advertised.

Im not sure if the double charge is one of uber\u2019s \u201cauthorization holds\u201d , but they have no right to be taking out that extra money out of my account.. If my fare is $8.78 ,dont take out another $8.78 for an authorization hold! What if i didnt have that other $8.78 in my account?? Then what?? And what if the double charge left me with nothing in my bank account?? Smh. Done with this app and switching to lyft. I never have these problems with them. Bye uber \u270c\ud83c\udffd"

Our driver assured me when when got into the car he knew we were going to Balboa island less than five minutes away.  He had just dropped off someone their before us.  He proceeded to take a completely different route, on the fwy, into Costa Mesa, with me in the back seat saying this was not right at all, which he didn\u2019t listen to.  30 minutes later we were who knows where but not even close to Balboa island.  My friend has to give him his phone with directions.  We completely missed the boat parade, I was fed up with him not listening, as we came all the way from San Diego.   Plus I was charged $20.

However, I and my wife have experienced on more than one occasion a driver accepting a ride request and then, perhaps after deciding that the trip would not be worth it, simply refuse to show, forcing us to cancel - and then having to pay the cancellation fee to a driver that made no attempt to arrive for a pickup.  Quite unlike taxi service - one would never pay for a taxi that didn\u2019t arrive.  Several of these circumstances during a trip to France have soured me on the service."

    "review": "I take Uber every day to and from work, so I interact with the app a lot. One thing that I really really dislike is that sometimes I get matched with a driver who is 15-20 minutes from my pick-up location. This in itself is not Uber\u2019s fault, I get that sometimes closer drivers aren\u2019t available. However if I want to cancel the ride because it\u2019s going to take way too long to get to my destination, I still get charged the fee. Even if I cancel right away. So I\u2019m either stuck waiting forever for a ride or I get charged for not wanting to put up with it. Not fair options, in my opinion.",

That seems discriminatory. \n\nAs for the lower-cost Uber express pool, Uber still doesn\u2019t know where I live and now wants me to walk farther up a hill to get to my ride.

I used to use Uber to take me to the airport a few times a month and it\u2019s always between $32-$38 but all of the sudden a few rides I was quoted my normal $35 and then charged $45.

One drove off with the cash I handed him to hold the vehicle (another driver said it\u2019s illegal to be accepting cash from passengers). Apart from being bad service it goes against the Americans with Disabilities Act. They should consider having their Uber Eats drivers swapping places with their regular drivers, the service is so much better! \nWould recommend everyone I know to switch to Lyft or a reliable local cab service immediately, no more using Uber unless there are immediate changes to stop this from happening to disabled people in future.",

My driver passed me twice on a clear street with no traffic and no crowd even after a phone call telling her where I was standing. I cancelled the trip as the map showed her driving way out of range in a totally different direction. Uber charged me a cancellation fee of $6 saying it will be refunded if I re-booked the same trip within 15 minutes. I pull up the same trip to the airport within 1 minute of cancelling. The trip is now $29. I switched to Lyft and got the trip for $14. If a company can operate in such a disgustingly and blatantly greedy manner I\u2019d rather take my trips elsewhere.",

However, the pick-up time may originally show up as 4 mins, then 4 becomes 6mins, and if your driver takes a wrong turn on a major highway or airport, that may turn to an additional 10 mins. As a person who uses Uber to get to work, I depend on reliable arrival times, and although I leave room for mistakes, some mistakes can be consequential. It would be great to cancel the driver that made several mistakes and is costing you time, and to take your chances on a new driver, but to do so with Uber may cost you. Uber charges you a significant amount for canceling your driver, so beware of cancelation charges with Uber.",

Well, I needed to get where I was going so I placed another ride, the count down till the driver was to pick me up started at 15 mins and got to 1 min and I was waiting outside for another 10 mins and he never showed. I called him and he said he doesn\u2019t know why it said he was coming cause he wasn\u2019t even online. So I cancelled that one as well. And got charged.

    "review": "On Sunday, Oct 6 I had a confirmed reservation for a ride from Hilton Garden Inn to Chattanooga Memorial Airport at 5 am.  I never received a driver\u2019s name or license before the driver arrived. \n\nFrederick arrived on time but did not drive to the drive-up entrance to the hotel.  It was pre-dawn and I had to walk out to look at the car parked on the street to determine if it was even an Uber. \n\nOnce inside we spent approximately 10 minutes driving around various city blocks. My uneasiness mounted. \nI asked if Frederick knew how to get to the airport and he said that he did but we continued driving in an erratic sequence of streets not following the GPS verbal instructions.  As we worked our way up to the Bluff Art District I asked him to return me to the hotel bcz I felt increasingly uneasy. \n\nHe did take me right back and I paid him $20 for his time coming to get me. However, I do not feel I should also be charged even a small fee by Uber for a trip that did not succeed in getting me even in the direction of the airport. \n\nPlease respond to this review. \nThank you. \nNancy Dean"

After I found it that I saved zero money and was charged the exact same amount as I was going to pay for my uber x. I appreciate the notification and understand the positives of getting a pool, but if I\u2019m going to ride with other people I expect to save a little money since the pool price was lower than the uber x price at the time of me ordering it."

I took a ride from an airport which should have an 8 dollar toll but Uber stared the toll charge is 98 dollars yet refuses to provide a toll breakdown. I tried to dispute it three months after and they refuse to even review the information or see the toll breakdown. The same typical responses are provided by customer service representatives clearly in India. They will not give any phone number or local contacts. This app is horrible and I will firmly recommend Lyft to everyone I know from now on - I have never had these issues there"

Now that I'm overseas, the app won't open without being updated again (after updating 4 days ago), but because I'm in a region that doesn't use Uber, it won't update. Uber has functionality that lets you use it for others. Don't you think we could use that even though we're not in your region?!! I have scheduled rides for others, but I wouldn't be able to do that either."

It\u2019s another story when the driver is trashy, the car is dirty, it smells, they drive poorly, they\u2019re rude, and they feel no need to ask if I\u2019m comfortable.

There are times where the app tells me that the driver would arrive in 10 mins and then they take twice as that long to get to where I am, and at other times its the complete opposite. I wrote about this problem before, and I got a response back, but instead of promising to fix the issue, or even apologizing for the problem, the response just directed me to Uber website to tell me why the maps are terrible. This the reason why I took one of the two stars I gave recently. Fix the problem, and I will give more stars back in my rating."

Use lyft. It can be cheaper, and they actually find you a ride in a timely manner.",

It was -8 degrees outside; was I supposed to wait outside until the driver came.

This is very frustrating, particularly when managing multiple payment options for different travel purposes. Deleting and reinstalling the app does not restore the functionality. According to other accounts, this has been an issue for months. Without the ability to edit or re-add an expired business card, I\u2019ll have to seek alternative services.",

I then used a online background company that ended scamming me out of my money cause I couldn\u2019t find any report on my person. This was exactly what I told them would happen and instead I was left in the wind. I do not recommend Uber to anyone ever. EVER!

There are definitely some metrics that Singapore needs to improve. \n\nFirstly, if I want to really be realistic about how on-time the uber cars arrive, I want to speak from my heart, that says never, but it\u2019s more like 15%. If you have an important meeting, you best add 10-15min extra. And  put the phone down, because watching that little car move away from you, or around in circles, will drive you crazy. \n \nSecondly, the knowledge of the drivers\u2019 city destinations are quite low. Don\u2019t expect more than 50% to know where MBFC is, which is quite a prominent series of towers in the financial centre. \n\nAnd if you\u2019re not from here, which I\u2019m not, they will often ask me \u201chere?\u201d Unfortunately, I don\u2019t know either, but I ask them to follow the \u201cfinish\u201d flag on the map. \n\nSo all in all, the app is still the same as in other cities - decent interface, easy to use, and have uber eats.

Driver arrived very quickly and we were in right away as we were waiting outside already. Even tough the he took longer route to the airport it was still short 7min ride and we were ok with that. I was happy and left $10 tip. Our big surprise was when I received my receipt and instead $24 it was almost $34. Multiple undisclosed fees and worst of all $5.47 \u201cwaiting time\u201d charge when there wasn\u2019t any waiting at all. Uber adjusted the ride to originally quoted rate after I filed complaint but this is not a service I will be using again. It will be Lyft from now on."

If I have an issue Uber does not care to make it a priority to offer assistance. They make it difficult to even email them about an issue.

I left my prescription glasses in the car which I can\u2019t see without. \nRegardless of Uber\u2019s policies, I have heard NOTHING either from the driver or Uber.\nAlso, it was early in the morning and the driver Erik was bending our ear (soliciting) about his up and coming business saying he was going to pitch thousands of Uber customers before his launching.  He also laboringly retrieved free information for his personal use regarding my profession.  Exhausting.  I\u2019m not surprised he didn\u2019t care about calling us back regarding my glasses.  Of course Uber has not responded to the written submissions we did by the book.\nWill give LIFT my business. Thank you.",

Upon arriving in Orlando I learned that there was no button or option, but that you had a book a trip with a driver and then ask if they had a car seat. If they did not you were to cancel your ride, get charged the cancellation fee, then continue the wild goose chase until you luckily found a driver that had a car seat. I strongly hope that in the future there is a more reliable way to ensure car seat availability that doesn\u2019t chance incurring such fees and having the uncertainty that you cannot find a ride to your destination.",

I was concerned with getting to the airport on time so a friend drove me. My driver did show up at scheduled time so missing the pick up was my fault. I see that the driver was compensated for their time...which is great as I would have requested a charge be put on my card had the no show policy not been in place. Again, my apology to the driver."

    "review": "There is NO customer service phone number. I took a 5 minute trip which the driver later changed to say I was going into a different state. Then, I was charged for a toll that I never passed through (since I never left the state). After back and fourth, I was given a refund for the toll but refused a phone number to speak to anyone. I don\u2019t see how they approved a toll charge when it would take a moments glance to see that it was impossible. The customer service has been on a steady MAJOR decline over the years with zero care for the customer or the service they receive. Really disappointed with Uber lately. Worst part is, they don\u2019t care at all!"

My husband was unable to get anyone on Uber, but I was finally able to after a half hour of trying. A sudden, unpredicted snowstorm hit that morning, but it took the Uber driver more than an hour to pick us up. Then when he got there, he went into the hotel to use the restroom, and I was charged a wait fee??? He was a nice guy, but we ended up missing our flight because he was so late getting to us.

Additionally, I have had drivers pick me up and seem to have no clue of where I am going. And when they find out that I am going somewhere they don\u2019t want to drive to, I get some attitude from them. Seems like there are glitches in the Uber app that need some desperate attention",

I\u2019m not riding in the back due to this 2. It\u2019s illegal and 3. If someone hit him I\u2019d be killed instantly. What does he do ? Has me cancel and I get charged a fee. I reached out to \u201cUber customer service\u201d to remove off my account since it wasn\u2019t my fault since feb of 2017. Guess how many times they\u2019ve told it\u2019s been removed only to have it still be there? I can see why their drivers are suing them. Ride  with Lyft.

I stopped using Uber a while ago because I did not feel it\u2019s safe to use as a female passenger (not a surprise given this company\u2019s sexist culture and history). I decided to try Uber out to see if anything changed. One recent case, the driver blatantly took a route that was double the length and took many different routes to lengthen the ride. After reaching out to support, they denied any support or any accountability of the driver. Needless to say, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this app."

Didn\u2019t expect this from Uber, a service that I use quite often in the US. Drivers in Bangalore do not know how to look up pick up or drop off location or how to answer messages in the app. Several times they canceled after accepting the ride. It was frustrating waiting for them and not being able to get a final ride even after giving precise directions on the app. I am ditching this in Bangalore and installing local ride share apps. I have been let down enough number of times already."

Your maps is HORRIBLE, causing trips to take much longer. Your ETAs are far from correct. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I go to request a ride and it says 2mins, only for it to change to 10+ minutes once confirmed. It\u2019s insanely frustrating. Not to mention the countless times a driver picks up a trip while \u201ccompleting a trip nearby\u201d, it takes them forever to get to you. There should be an option for riders to not accept those types of rides.",

I think many of the drivers there take advantage and pretend to be having trouble with their maps as they take the longest route possible. This makes no sense as they are not paid per mile. So strange. Perhaps because so many have recently moved to the states."

You can call an uber pool and be picked up in 1 minute or it could arrive in over 20 minutes. Makes it difficult to stay on your schedule. They will take you around an entire city, even at high traffic times, rather than picking up riders going in the same direction. The support is also lacking. You cannot talk to a real person or call a phone number. You cannot get refunded for a ride even if it made you late for work unless you reference deleting the app and downloading uber, that sets the machine learning off."

I took screenshots of the time he sat in one area being \"7minutes away\" for over 5 minutes. And on top of that, I recently was picked up at the airport and my \"2 minute wait\" in the rain was 10. Driver looked like he was standing in the same spot the entire time and when I called him, he said he was almost there and proceeded to ask me where I was going. It's just ridiculous. If I hadn't paid for their stupid monthly ride pass (car trouble) I'd be using lyft. Switching for sure once this ride pass is done."

I was in my way to friends place when we had to pick up another Uber rider in a sketchy neighborhood. The Uber driver pulls over to ask two gentlemen if they were the Uber riders. Next thing they open up both of the back doors and wave something in their pocket like they had a gun screaming for my phone. I gave up my phone and they ran off. They Uber driver was going to drive after them but I told him to not to because I didn\u2019t want to be shot at. We exited the neighborhood and we called Uber and police. Uber has been no help and are not sensitive to my traumatizing experience.",

I really think you guys should change this because it would work wonders for your customers so they won\u2019t be refused because their uber drivers don\u2019t want to go to NYC or to an airport.",

The reason Uber is getting 3 of 4 stars is because of how long this app has been out, I find it ridiculous that the app would not allow me to use Apple Pay due to internal errors. I had to manually input card info which is less than ideal when it gives me the option to use Apple Pay. Other than that solid app that is straight forward.",

The driver took her 30 minutes the wrong way to a completely different city. This resulted in her total drive with Uber to be over an hour and over $120. The driver even stopped for gas along the way. He didn\u2019t speak during their ride. Did not apologize for the mix up then even hit her with the trunk when she was dropped off. When this was brought to Ubers attention, they refunded a total of $7.95. I have always been and will continue to be a Lyft rider, where customer safety and service is a top priority.",

He didn\u2019t even get out of the car to help me put my carry on in the back seat. He played hard rock and didn\u2019t ask if I was ok with the music.

My poor 70 year Aunt was told she has to get out in the pouring rain at an address that was not the address I put in. And the driver kept saying under the new rules he could not drop her off at her house. The driver had to end up calling the supervisor because my aunt was really upset.

I also can\u2019t find a general assistant email address for general inquiries. \n\nTherefore, I believe there are three resolutions to this problem.  1.  Write a bad review and someone might respond. 2.  Quit using Uber.  Or 3.

Uber is just more expensive and I end up getting the same non English understanding drivers anyways. Would love if they could listen to me and stop after the driveway then go half way up it. Otherwise the apps quick at getting me a ride but the frustration is real.",

Early February 15th in Austin Texas my GF placed a ride and it said 5 minutes until the driver arrives. The driver drove past us and went to a car wash. Made us wait over 30 minutes just so he could leave the car wash and cancel on us. We could not cancel even though our ride was over 25 minutes late without receiving a cancel fee.

When Uber came to Las Vegas it was a sign of relief because we no longer had to deal with the tyrant taxi companies!! And this is the true taxi companies take busy streets and longer routes to make the fare go up and this is exactly what Uber is been doing for the last few months !! Nickel and diming it\u2019s probably the new business moto for a lot of companies now on days !! God bless you and have a wonderful day .",

    "review": "I was at this new place that I wasn\u2019t familiar with. I opened uber and the blue arrow shows that my location so I selected that as the pick up spot. Turned out the pick up spot was a mile away from me. The driver arrived at the location and was really mad that I wasn\u2019t there. I was confused as I think the blue arrow is showing where I\u2019m currently at, that\u2019s why I selected that as the pick up location. \nThis is not the first time when uber messes up my location. The location service is very poor. Sometimes I walk to a wrong place bc the direction on uber is misleading."

Let us know more about it by dropping the details at t.uber.com/contact and we'll connect. Also, now, when requesting a Pool, you'll even have the option of Express Pool, where you'll have to take a short walk to and from your ride for a lower price. If you would prefer not to walk, toggle back to regular Pool to pay a little more for a door-to-door ride.",

    "review": "This evening I had to walk a few blocks to a pickup place and as soon as I ran across the street, the Uber driver left.  The car arrived to the pickup spot before I did. Then I had to wait 8 minutes on the next ride.  And then I was dropped off two blocks away.  I thought Uber was supposed to be better than waiting on a cab.  Perhaps if we know upfront how long the wait is and how far the walk will be ahead of time the customer can make a more informed choice. I don\u2019t like this new way with stops like a city bus.  I was totally disappointed with the service."

    "review": "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because the app I made in Asia, but the app is the worst in many ways. I never take Uber in the mornings because I work 7 miles away from home so sometimes in the morning we will pick up to three people and drop some of them off in the complete opposite direction. Unless you\u2019re taking Uber X you\u2019re okay but taking it frequently can be expensive. \nWhen people use express, the app will have the dropped off at the most inconvenient and dangerous locations. \n\nI have been very happy with Scoop and Lyft."

    "review": "I requested a ride, but the street outside the hotel front door was under construction, so I walked to the intersection at the end of the building. After waiting 15 minutes at the corner after sending a message to the driver with my location, the driver cancelled me.  Not only was my ride cancelled while I was standing outside in windchill O deg weather waiting, but I was late for a dinner meeting and had to request another UBER driver.  To top it all off, I was charged $5 for a cancellation fee, when I didn\u2019t cancel - the driver did!\n\nI usually rate Uber drivers 5 stars and tip, but this non-trip was a 1 star, and I would expect a refund of the $5 cancellation, since I never cancelled!"
