Videos do pause automatically after spending sometime surfing through videos in video feed.\n\n3. When we go to a creator's page, open a video and then scroll to move to next, videos don't get aligned properly on screen. \n\n4. Provide an option to become a beta tester through app.\n\n5. \"Comments\" option was not really needed. I liked it's absence. But would love to see a \"dislike\" button.\n\n6. Day mode and dark mode both should be there. My iPhone is set to turn to one of these modes depending upon sunrise and sunset. Would be great if your app follows it too.\n\n6. Last but not the least, I hope you have a control and plans to avoid spreading cringe content. Also focus on not spreading only big creator's videos who were famous on Tik Tok. People didn't really like them.",

After all I really appreciate the initiative for the development of this app.\n\n1)I\u2019m not able to see the notifications on my profile nor the likes are getting displayed there\n\n2) When we are looking at the newsfeed theres a problem in that, and it feels so inefficient in which we are unable to check who liked our videos or who shared it. \n\n3) The page doesn\u2019t get refresh when there\u2019s a problem raises \n\n4) Its response is very slow and late.",

Silly mistake.\nSnapchat lens icons are missing sometimes, lens such as flawless, slinky, get funky are having no icon at all. \nSuggestions which I like to use: \n\nI am a software employee and I have few suggestions to make.\n\nMay be you can allow verified users to test your product at regular intervals, to improve user experience. With providing certain incentives to testers. \nProvide an option to go to \u201coriginal sound\u201d owner profile when clicked on the name \u201coriginal sound by xyz\u201d\nProvide an option to chose multiple language options when creating profile.\nPlease allow user to upload readymade videos.\nAs an iPhone user, I save images and videos in iCloud or some other cloud storage before uploading into Moj, due to less internal memory. Please allow user to upload through different popular means, such as Apple files, google drive, jio cloud e.t.c.,\nAllow us to follow and \u201cunfollow along with warning message\u201d if follower really wants to unfollow \u201cat the profile icon itself\u201d. Currently we have to open profile to unfollow, which I feel is unnecessary step. \nPlease integrate multiple popular apps, such as signal and telegram. Because Some of us don\u2019t really like Whatsapp.\nWould appreciate if more gender options were there. And allow us to chose non-binary pronouns. Such as they/them instead of her/him \nMay be you can allow users to have multiple accounts and an option to switch between/among those accounts.\n\nFinal suggestion: \n\nWhy don\u2019t you guys come up with a competitor for whatsapp/signal/ telegram. This is the right time to do that. \n\nThanks \n\nTejas",

    "review": "After repeated attempts i find it absolutely impossible to login to my account! i used my mobile number for logging in to my account initially, then one day all of a sudden the app treated me like a first timer and started asking login or signup options. The more pathetic situation is that i am not able to login to ny existing account or evencreate a new one . \nThe steps shown below is a step by step description aboutthe occurence of errors . I would like to explain the process to you clearly so read accordingly \n1. Opened app from the home page\n2. Me clicking the man head on the far right bottom corner of the app to see my account \n3. Here the app displays login options like : login/signup at the top and login options like Facebook email and mobile number below it \n4. Me , trying to login to my account using all the three options and none of them really working \n5. From the very moment i enter my phone number, i will get an otp . After entering otp on time within a snap of 1sec same login options appear again ! \n6. The most sad thing is that none of the login options is working and interestingly i can still find my account through search button ! \n7. I was new to the app and i liked it at the beginning very much and i also posted like 4 or 5 videos within two days , from the third day onwards i was not able to post ang videos at all\n\nSo please do something to rectify this error. I am sure that many of them are also facing same situation as it is evident from the new youtube videos with the title MOJ APP NOT WORKING!?",
