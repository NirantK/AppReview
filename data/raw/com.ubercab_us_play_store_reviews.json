    "content": "Uber has really gone down hill. I use both uber and lyft, as uber is often cheaper, but it's not worth the savings anymore. For example last night I called an uber from an airport. The airport, like most, has a designated pickup area from where I scheduled the pick up. I watched this idiot drive by the spot (well marked, loads of signs) three times then just cancel. 20 minutes I waited for what was advertised 3 minutes. It was advertised as $35. Uber says \"finding you a new ride. Your new ride price has gone up\" ONE HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS!!! What the BS uber? If my driver cancels because he's too stupid to follow signs, you don't get to more than TRIPLE the price?! I refused the ride and every one was coming in at that price. So I called a friend that I hated to bother and just had him drive me home. (My phone was dead and I only had uber on my ipad. I fixed that as soon as I got home!) When trying to reach uber, I got a message saying they won't issue more refunds to me because I've gotten too many. Uh So uber is admitting \"we've screwed up too many times and won't be paying you back\" Each and every refund was found legit. Drivers that dropped me off halfway through the ride because they needed to 'get home' and I'm stuck in a place I don't know. Drivers that smoked cigarettes. One had porn in his car to \"cater to his normal clientelle\" in reno. These were valid refund claims but uber says any valid claim in the future won't be paid out. So bye uber! And going to do as much as I can to make sure I'm far from the only one that leaves you. This review is step one.",

    "content": "Even though I've had a few good rides for sure... offlate, I've had multiple bad experiences with Uber cabs, especially in Mumbai. The drivers were rude, and unsafe. Another thing is that they keep calling before picking you up, even after the ride is confirmed, to ask where you want to go and then ask you to cancel the ride. It's very irritating. Uber help is not available for an ongoing ride. What if you are facing a problem during the ride. Zero regard for a customer's safety and convenience",

If we cancel the ride, Uber charges cancellation fee (what an irony). These drivers waste almost 15-30 minutes and we can't do anything for that. Uber prioritise the driver's interests while completely ignoring the customers. As per Uber, customers have a lot of extra time but every minute counts for drivers.",

    "content": "A TAXI IS CHEAPER IN MY AREA! Ever since Uber let drivers set rates it's become nonsense. The only people who fall for it are ignorant of the competition that exists, and that included me until today. I used to love using Uber. It used to be cost effective for nearly everything from a short trip to the golf course 4 miles away, or longer trips to LAX airport nearly 50 miles away. I even thought of getting rid of my car and using Uber exclusively, that's how effective it was. What a mistake that would have been! There's the Uber price, which can never find a car, then there's \"a ride available at a higher rate\" price, which is constant now. For me, a trip to the golf course used to be less than $10, now it's nearly $40. A trip to LAX used to be cheaper than parking there for three days, (about $90) now it's $400 EACH WAY! To be clear, the app quotes a reasonable rate, the drivers push that up to ridiculous levels. Yes they deserve to make money blah blah blah... but they are pushing themselves out of having as job. TAXI CABS ARE CHEAPER. Today I was quoted over $40 to go to the golf course only 4 miles away. The app says $13, but the drivers pushed the rate up to over $40. THE SAME RIDE IN A TAXI IS $15! I installed Lyft for the first time and got a ride to the golf course for $9. I had my fun and spent ~$25 on beer including tip. I got a ride home for $10. If I had to pay $40 EACH WAY, I simply wouldn't go or I'd drive myself and forego the beer. Where's the fun in that? Even a taxi would have been less than $15. Local taxi rates are $3.5 just to get the cab, plus $2.75 per mile. That's $14.5 total for 4 miles. I imagine most people in CA own their own car and use Uber for convenience. Well, $40 for a 4 mile trip worth less than $15 isn't convenient, I'd rather walk... but realistically will use Lyft or a cab instead. One thing for sure, I'm never using Uber again until they regain control of their business and their costs.",

There's an error in the system that applies your fare back to the tip amount and they aren't refunding anyone. my ride was supposed to be 12.98 with tip but because the fair was doubled they charged me $20.96 and they will not give me the $7.98 back. I've been told numerous times that they're working on it but no one will refund me. Go to Lyft they don't steal from you.",

Nice comfort for ppl who have some money and who dont have personal vehicle and dont want to drive too owing to ridiculous and rampant disregard for traffic rules. This in turn symbolizes how less we value human life or living life of a common person. Regards from India. Hope an year after Coronavirus lockdown, the Uber business is getting on track. I am happy to help. Thanks.",
