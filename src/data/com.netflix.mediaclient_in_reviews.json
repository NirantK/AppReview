Over time and with the things you watch it picks out movies / tv shows that are similar to the program. Not to mention the HOLIDAYS!! WHOOP WHOOOP!! GENUINELY love throughout the year as the seasons change Netflix does as well . It's like Netflix could sense a winter day with a perfect movie fit just for you or family !",

My kids go to their grandparents on weekends i work and they watch it over there.

They took my entire LIFE away when they took away \"the office\" so therefore i want to take theirs. I can't express the level of hate i feel towards Netflix as of January 1st. I. Hate. Them.",

I couldn't find a way to uninstall this app after, also a note I'm using Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (SM-N960F). So please fix the problem as soon as you can as this app are getting useless to me. If this problem doesn't get fixed, I'm going to give you a 1-star. If it does get fixed I will edit the review and give you a 5-star",
