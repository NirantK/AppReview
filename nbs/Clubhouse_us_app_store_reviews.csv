"Let me start by saying that this is, by far, the most excited I’ve been about a new social network since Instagram first entered the ring. But, in my couple days of usage, I’ve began to notice one thing that really stands out as being a bit annoying: lack of speaker indication. When rooms have a healthy amount of people on the stage, you find yourself playing a game of hide & seek as you tediously scroll to find who’s avatar has the ring. So here’s my 2 possible suggestions & wishes:

1) As they already have for “Followed by Speakers”, make a “Moderators” section at the top of the room and a “Stage” section below it. Then make it to where speaker notifications (“___ is speaking” as a drop down notification) are exclusive to when a moderator is speaking. This way, the amount of scrolling to find who is talking would be reduced to on stage participants only. And the audience will be alerted when a moderator is speaking.

2) Decrease the profile sizes of those on stage as the number increases so that more avatars can fit on the screen. That way, when someone is speaking, we can see who it is without scrolling as much."|Who is Talking?|Jacket Coatman|5|False|2021-01-07 14:56:34|
This app use to be Amazing back in January but now the app is overflowing with people taking over stages, removing mods to the audience and out of the room, people get mad at others for hosting popular rooms so they’ll have and are paying people to report profiles on this app so the person can be suspended and then when this happens everyone migrates back to the person who sent the reporters. I also feel like there was no need to change the African American man from the apps profile picture either. Why does it always have to be a Caucasian person? We have Chinese Hispanic Dominican and all other races in the United States you could have picked from but you guys chose the one Caucasian man who “brought life” to Club house as there are thousands of others whose brought life to the app as well. People want this app public and I believe you guys can continue to work on the app while doing so. It’s just not the same, everyone makes rooms and we consistently get shadow banned for the oddest reasons, it’s way too many rules to keep up with. Back in December and January people could get rooms up to 600+ now we barley get 200+ and that’s why I believe the app needs to go public since everyone wants to become moderators now we can’t engage with a lot of people anymore since everyone is spread out. Please consider all of these issues and maybe me and the others I’ve spoken with will come back to the app but until then we will have to give Club house a break. -Thank You|Club house Bugs|Roni1019|2|False|2021-03-25 14:10:40|
I absolutely love clubhouse, the only thing that I dislike is industry people charging others to speak on a free platform that was built to create the connection between the industry world with individuals who are somewhat already in the industry. I feel like clubhouse needs to keep the app invite only maybe doing 1 invite every two months to stop the app from being over saturated like Facebook or Instagram where anyone can join. I think they need to have someone go into these rooms and make sure all guidelines are being met because most of them are not. This shouldn’t be a popularity app, but a tool to help creative minds link with professionals and network. People should not be charged to enter a public room by people claiming to be professionals. Cashapp’s should not be allowed in profile descriptions on a public platform. And I feel like being that the app was create to be an open form raising of hands should not be disabled. Moderators should just pick who that want on stage but not make someone feel less then by disabling hands.|Amazing app|reallyshan|5|False|2020-12-30 13:20:45|
I love this app because it allows you actually have a conversation with numerous people that you may have NEVER had the chance to talk to. But the one thing I that should change on this is maybe a space in the chat where the person who is talking make their picture bigger so that you can find their info, follow them on the app or on Instagram. Sometime I’m trying to figure out who is talking to connect with them but I have to scroll down to see who is talking instead of their profile picture popping up a little bigger (like zoom, I hate to compare. But I think it should show a bigger picture of the person talking but still have all the little pictures of people in the discussions. And maybe move the IG icon next to the follow button so that you can get back to the chat quick without having to scroll all the way down. Could you guys also a question chat so it is easier to the moderators can answers questions for the audience of course allowing the mediators to pick which questions they would like to answer. Again this app is great !!! I look forward to seeing this app flourish wish y’all the best.|I love this app !!!!|Yazmin P Jones|4|False|2021-01-14 18:26:40|
Let me start by saying this app is amazing and actually it’s the only social media app I get on every day now. My IG and FB are suffering because I’m all about Clubhouse every day all day. With that said, I’m frustrated. I was accidentally logged out of my account today and can’t get back in now. I’ve searched high and low on how to successfully log back into my account and I don’t see the information anywhere. Why isn’t that easily available? I know I didn’t delete my account but I can’t get into my existing account anymore. I tried reaching out to Clubhouse support via email and Twitter and haven’t received a response. I can admit it wasn’t that long ago that I sent that info in but I was expected to be in a room and can’t even access it now. The problem now is when I click on the app it’s trying to make me sign up all over again. Asking me to pick a new user name. I need to access my groups and contacts so I’m not trying to create a new user name. This review is to let it be know that Clubhouse is one of the best apps I’ve been a part of in a  long time but how can I continue to enjoy it when I can’t even access my account that’s I’ve grown to love? Can someone help me with this??|Help!|JeanEats|3|False|2021-01-18 18:15:16|
Additional features I’d appreciate:     1.) I’d love to have an “add to calendar” function to save to an itinerary within the app (kinda like apps for academic conferences) so that I can see the things I’m most interested in listed in a separate place from everything in the “Upcoming for You” tab. If this function was added, I’d prefer to be able to be able to “double-book” in the itinerary if at all possible (e.g. so I can peruse a few rooms during one time slot before settling into the best fit for me and so, if my top choice room finishes first, I can jump over to my second choice before it’s over).     2.) I’d also like a way to “favorite”/prioritize certain users and clubs so I see them at the top of the “Upcoming for You” tab.     3.) I’d love to be able to search for room titles (and maybe descriptions?) using keyword search in the “Explore” tab.     4.) I’d like for club meetings to be linked to their page so if I know somethings happening for one club, but it isn’t scheduled in advance or I haven’t saved it in my itinerary, I can quickly search for the club page and enter the room there.|Great!

"This app definitely offsets one of the most fundamentaly important things that we as a people been missing ever since the pandemic started; social gatherings. This app is perfect for networking with like minded people to help you on this journey called life. The app is a lil addictive ngl. Its a great alternative to regular podcast bc its live and interactive. You guys definitely cultivated a great app and would love to see it grow. My only form of criticism is that the audio could be a bit louder and a bit more clear or a way for you to stream music seamlessly through the phone/app  overall five stars ""💫💫💫💫💫""and when this company become public, I would love to invest in the brand ‼️

Re: would also love to see the explore page i like that ability to change rooms with different topics not just one specific thing. If it follows that curve it will turn into ig and it would lose its novelty to me at least. I dont wanna see 50 rooms named: ""music review""  .....I like philanthropy and stocks too y know?

"Listennnnn!! This app is the “stage” I said I would stand on and speak to the masses. 2020 said ok the stage is virtual babygurl but you gon’ be just as profound because now ya don’t hafta worry about hair and makeup! Just speak!
This app revives the art of verbal communication like the good ol’ days when you had a 30 ft house phone cord so you could kick up your feet and chat with your friends about your goals! Just what we need during this pandemic to keep hearts, minds and spirits LIFTED!
When you are intentional with your connections and your message, this app brings your tribe to you! Results NOT rhetoric with the genuine interactions! Keep a notepad, sticky notes, SOMETHING because the jewels being dropped on a daily will blow your mind and shift your life!
And thus ends my dissertation on Clubhouse:  The juxtaposition of social distancing and verbally embracing✊🏾

"Before joining Clubhouse, I was unclear on what the application would truly offer beyond being yet another social media platform. After joining Clubhouse I became aware of both how misguided I was about Clubhouse and how much as a new small business owner I needed this forum.

The connections I’ve made have been various but all have been invaluable. I’ve received what can arguably be tens of thousands of dollars worth of free advice about everything from branding to best business practices. The potential business collaborations are unfolding but I believe that they will be mutually beneficial.

I think the big challenge for Clubhouse going forward is to not try to be a platform for all people and all things. I’ve seen some of the rooms take on the postures and topics that are more “traphouse” than Clubhouse. I am not advocating classism but I think that perhaps making “hallways” for certain types of rooms may be interesting (but this may create echo chambers that would be counter Clubhouse)."|The Best Social Media Platform For Building Your Business|Ikigai Guy|5|False|2021-02-18 21:17:43|
"The app requires your phone number (first red flag), then it requires your contacts (the list of which it keeps forever, for all we know - second red flag). So anyone who has ever had your phone number not only can see your profile, but also share it with anyone or any room without your consent (a giant red flag - at the time of writing there's no way to selectively restrict your profile to certain users). Which makes Clubhouse a superspreader feeding ground for stalkers.
Currently there's no way to simply delete your account, you can only request its removal and wait until someone attends to it - another red flag, that points at data collection, likely to sell it to third parties. At the time of writing Clubhouse ""temporarily"" stores voice recordings on their servers, which is a complete U-turn from their initial promises during the release. Some of the data the app collects from your phone has nothing to do with the service it provides - yet another red flag, and yet another app that treats its users as a product.
On top of that, despite the app being in its early days, there's little to no moderation of hateful and toxic content, making it easy to exploit for people spreading dangerous conspiracies."|Zero respect for privacy. Red flags all over.|valhakun|1|False|2021-02-17 22:13:16|
"I loved loved loved the app until today. Before the update, I got to jump in and out of very diverse chats, from finance to music to psychology to poetry to straight up gossip chatrooms. After the update; my listening is very limited to the people I chose to follow and their interest in the two weeks I’ve been on the app.

Clubhouse has turned itself into another Instagram app where it shows you targeted content based off of the content you “liked” when you first joined. I HATE IT HERE NOW.

What made the app great for me was I had access every space, every topic, everyone everywhere (within the app, of course) with just a click on a globe. Now I have to scroll thru people I follow to find other people to follow in hopes the start an interesting room when in reality they are avid listeners and note takers like myself.

Since you removed the explorer page, I can’t expand my knowledge or explore other topics I may not have known existed. Since I didn’t follow enough people early on, I lost access to many spaces including psychological and finance chats which is directly within my field. 

 So now with such a heavy heart, I dislike the app because I’m stuck listening to the same people talking about the same things every other day. 

Can y’all bring back the explorer page?! Please and thank you. 

If not; I’ll stick to Twitter b|c there I can at least click on a thread within the thread and learn something new."|Great app but unfortunately it’s limited now.|Ensu F.|5|False|2020-11-17 13:52:47|
This is a wonderful new approach to social media. It’s so much more personal and effective at getting to really know and connect with people! That being said, I do like having the ability to link my other social media profiles on my clubhouse profile, but the issue I have here is that you can only link one Instagram account and one Twitter. I personally only have one Twitter so that is fine, but I do use multiple Instagram pages for separate niche facets of my content. For example I have a personal page, a business page, and an art page. I would love to be able to link at least two if not all of them on my clubhouse profile if possible! I feel it would be easier for people to reference my work or contact information easily during conversation if they were able to find the correct link on my profile. If that makes sense!

"So I definitely found my crowd of ppl and it’s awesome and heartwarming. I can network if I so choose or just explore different rooms with my interest. Definitely five stars. I can’t wait to see how the app is improved over time. Here are some of my suggestions:
▪️A clapping or heart emoji when someone says something that resonates. And everyone can see the reactions of each other or maybe just the speaker. 
▪️A brighter color highlighting the speaker(s) and maybe if their icon became bigger so when you want to address someone it will be easier to find them when scrolling through the room. Design feature idea: what if the stage icons were set in a circle with the speaker in the middle. Idk. Just putting that out there. 
▪️Maybe a raised hand feature when on stage to speak next. Sometimes ppl talk over each other and while mostly everyone is polite about it we forget who should speak next. Maybe a number system! for example when I am done speaking whoever raising their hand on stage after me gets the number 1, 2, 3 and so on, on their icon and they get to go next. 

All in all I love the app and it helps greatly in these times. Some ppl are getting jobs, it’s helping small business, ppl are doing interviews and find their safe spaces to express themselves. Excellent work to the team. Love and light."|Love this app|celihere|5|False|2021-01-17 18:49:07|
Although I enjoy using this app at most times. I have come to realize one of the major flaws which concerns me. I was in a chat playing a game with most of my clubhouse friends. During this game I had said something which was allowed but a individual didn’t have the same view us me so they got sensitive and ended up blocking me. Unfortunately this individual happened to be friends with many of the people I associate myself with on this app so therefore when the person goes into the chat before me I am not able to join the chat. I feel the need to speak on this because I honestly find it under that someone could prevent you from enjoying a good time and gaining new information from others due to their feelings. There should be a better way to avoid these sort of problems. One can be not being able to notice the other is in the chat or even hear them speak so problems could be avoided|Blocking people|bapukobe|4|False|2021-01-14 22:20:46|
"But I love clubhouse.  It gives you access to talks with high level people.  It actually provides value in your life.  

To the dev team, some user notes:

I have notifications enabled but banners on IOS don’t give me good information.  I get a partial list of people in a room, but the banner runs out of space before I see what the room is.  A better format would be “[room name]: on stage is [people names]”.  As they are now, the notifications are basically useless. 

On the scheduled rooms up at the top of the feed, it would be good to be able to schedule myself to listen in on the room, instead of having to remember to go back and find it again.  Then get a notification that the selected room is beginning.  

It would be good to be able to subscribe to recurring rooms, in addition to following users.  When someone creates a room, they might have the option to “make recurring” and then select which recurring room it falls into.  This would allow for unique room titles, but also allow listeners to never miss a weekly/daily room they love. 

Finally, I’d say to add an estimated duration function.  When someone starts a room, they put in the expected length of the discussion so that listeners can plan their time."|I hate social media|Brosef Josef|5|False|2021-02-26 16:15:05|
"I practically don’t turn it off, it’s like the 90s party line lol.. It’s great to actually hear voice with knowledge, inspiration, honest help, laughter, and emotions. Not just text and emojis that leave you to your own emotion of interpreting what’s read. I’m glad it’s bringing back communication, something that’s been lost with technology advices. I enjoy that there’s a invite only I hope they keep it that way, and better transparency which keeps away those that hide behind the keyboard. It’s good open dialect. Just what the people need 😊

Only fall back with the app for me..I just hate it consistently ask to find a stronger signal, even when I have full cell bars but not connected to a WiFi.. it’ll play anywhere on my iPad with or without WiFi...but my cell it just doesn’t stay connected unless I’m on WiFi. 😒...

Clubhouse is a great app, especially considering it’s still in beta mode. I’ve been able to connect with people all over the world! Suggested improvements: 1) It’s very difficult to see who is speaking even with a modest amount of people on stage. I find myself having to ask “Who said that? I can’t find you” a little too often. I suggest making the ring around the speaker a more pronounced color such as green, orange or even black as a great first step. 2) Secondly, I find the notifications super aggressive. Even on the “infrequently” mode, I am still getting notifications back to back about the same room which is distracting when you try to play a game or other app that doesn’t turn off notifications. 3) Finally, it would be nice to have an option to look up a profile and see what room someone is in...

I wish I never joined this app. One important thing to know is that when you receive an invite, the person who invited you permanently appears on your profile. This is pretty disturbing to me, and sends my OCD into overdrive. I was invited by someone who I don’t really know, and their account looks spammy when you click on it. I don’t like the fact that I’m forever associated with this person now. It makes me look bad, and if I knew this, I would’ve just waited to be invited by a close friend. Still, though, it definitely bothers me that this information is freely displayed on every profile. Please change this. It bothers me so much and is a major privacy issue. There is also no possible way to delete this app yet either, which is extremely frustrating. So now people with my phone number can find my profile and see all this personal information and I have no way to delete the app. There’s nothing I can do. It’s about to make me have a panic attack. I’m so angry and upset right now. I hate this app.|Maddening|USAFdejavu|1|False|2021-03-13 06:46:47|
I was adamant to join at first. It’s reassuring that they keep it invite only to help filter through our point of reference and contacts. Plenty of powerful keynotes and quality material including the incredible minds who open their hearts, life learning experiences and motivational energy. Exactly the kind of platform I have been searching for. Thank you for designing this. I am looking forward to hosting and engaging with everyone. I actually feel confident about networking through this app where as I had to learn to restrict and create barriers with other social media streams because of the dangers we now fully understand that comes with exploring social media.

"I absolutely love this app so far. It has such a great and eclectic mix of people (especially POC) from a breadth of backgrounds; the conversations I’ve joined and listened to have been genuinely interesting, at all hours; and I like the range of topics. 

It’s quickly becoming my favorite social platform — and, yes, it is addictive. 

But I definitely echo some of the other reviews. It would be great to explore topics I didn’t pre-select during sign-up, just to see what else is out there. Being able to at least ‘react’ to conversations would be nice (even with an emoji to show appreciation). And I wonder how bloated it’s going to feel when it’s completely open (it’s already pretty big but the conversations have been on point and pretty respectful vs. Twitter that just gets crazy)."|LOVE it so far but curious to see how it develops.|Definitely_Human|5|False|2021-01-12 07:11:40|
I am completely hooked this time. There is something special about conversations where nobody is trying to be something they are not. You don’t need to worry about lights and cameras, you just bring yourself just as you are. There are good content, good opportunities for real conversation and of course is all audio. I like also that it makes inclusion better, nobody is worried about disability, color, or looks. The UI is clean and easy to use. It would be nice if there was an indication of who is talking. There is nobody going crazy and interropting others. Over all I love this app and whatever little things they will be able to fix over time. I just hope I won’t be to hooked.

I LOVE this app! It has been 8 days and I am absolutely addicted! I heard about it from a travel group I’m in on Facebook and thought I’d give it a try. Not only am I enjoying my travel clubs (shout out to GLT!), but I am also enjoying clubs for my other interests! I’m a teacher, so I’m in clubs for education and science. I love languages, so I am in clubs for people learning the same languages I am! In my free time, I join social rooms and talk to random people, some have already become my friends. You can Ping people into rooms you think they would like, and they can do the same for you. Finally, I end my day by falling asleep listening to the Lullaby Club.

Users should be able to see how long a room has been active because there are more times I enter a room that’s wrapping up than catching it from the start. And if the room creators are only hosting for only so long then it should be timed and they can be given the option to extend the room if that time runs over. It will be able to give users the opportunity to know at what point did they enter the conversation, users will know when it will end so they can plan accordingly, and moderators don’t have to explain as much. Another feature should be planning a schedule of rooms you want to enter in a queue. Give the option to start in one room and when another scheduled room starts it will jump to that one unless the user chooses to stay in the room they’re in longer.|Timer|Sksuwiqow2&284$38|4|False|2021-01-25 16:37:14|
this is quite simply a revolutionary take on social media, and for me personally being in the creative entertainment world it’s been incredibly beneficial to me just being able to network and put a voice to peoples names instead of just seeing a traditional “DM”. i’ve been in rooms with attorneys, other musicians, experienced people all around who are willing to talk and she’s their experiences or even advice to anybody listening. it’s a game changer. i think the invite only aspect should stay though, as the loose-exclusivity makes it a lot more powerful. it’s not like it’s that hard to get invited either, just have to know some people. but again, it’s a game changer for social media in my opinion|best social platform i’ve ever used|Soeoen|5|False|2020-12-07 08:08:24|
So glad that for the first time a social platform cares about the accessibility for us the blind, and that you took the time to label almost everything and we can navagate this app easily.  I give it a 95% on the accessibility.  The button to schedule a new even is not labeled and some issues on the buddy list.  I am bilingual English?Spanish so navagating with apple’s screen reader, VoiceOver is very easy, however, my blind people who don’t speak English are having difficulty or a little resistant to use it.

"I found out about this app from an article in August or so  of 2020 and immediately looked it up to download. I found out it was invite only and since it was relatively new still I decided to sign up, thinking it wouldn’t be that long since I got in early.  Half a year later I’m still waiting for my invite text, but that’s not the best part. 

I live in Shanghai and the Chinese community has recently found out about this app because of a little chat Elon musk had with RobinHood. So it’s gotten quite large over here. So I’m seeing the people that have been able to sign up has spiked because now most of my Chinese friends ( who has no idea about this app two days ago ) have accounts except me, someone who has been waiting for ,what feels like , forever. 

I understand that it’s mostly my FOMO that has me upset but I don’t understand that, just because one irrelevant person got into the group that now I have other friends who are asking me what this app is, have accounts, and I don’t when i was really excited to join this community from the ground floor and discuss really awesome cross culture issues . Now I feel like I’m missing all of the good stuff already.

"I’ve really enjoyed the communities on Clubhouse, but the actual experience of using the app is bad. The audio quality is terrible—the levels of every speaker vary widely, and often change dramatically within any given session. Also the fact that you can’t hear yourself when speaking is a major problem. For an app whose sole focus is audio this is unacceptable.

The ability to communicate other than actually speaking is nonexistent. It would be helpful to add some additional messaging options. And the notification options are also poor. There should be better filters to help promote rooms you only care about. The current settings don’t work well at all.  

Overall, there’s a lot of potential with this app, but it needs much work, particularly with the awful audio."|Great community, bad app|Milty_sug|3|False|2021-03-15 08:38:27|
Honestly I have already had so many enriching experiences, educational experiences, great connections... but I’m confused at HOW I find a chat that is apparently open? I see lots of people on other social channels advertising their talks and encouraging you to join but I can’t find them. Why aren’t they listed on the user profile who is hosting and moderating them? Also, the “upcoming for you” section is just about always garbage. I have no idea how this is recommended for me but I’ll assume this app still needs some help with algorithms and I’m sure it will improve as the app is updated and improved. It would just be nice for it to be more curated, intuitive, and an in-app walkthrough would be chill.|Lots of room for improvement but amazing.|Thehollybadger|4|False|2021-02-01 06:10:36|

I’m grateful my friend/colleague Leila Steinberg introduced me with an invite.   It has a fresh vibe.  With new innovations there will be growth.  It will be exciting to experience the shifts.

This is an amazing concept, like an interactive podcast. It allows networking with well known professionals to underground/upcoming creatives. It's a great thing but can sometimes get overwhelming. I think If there are easy access buttons for moderator such as mute all, mute multiple at once and mute rows. Second, easy access for speakers such as step down, and also a secondary raise hand button for speakers or an ability to signal to moderator something. The hand raise option is not available for speakers, but only for audience members who want to speak. That I think should extend to speakers, it will make moderating easier. We should have an availability to block/hide rooms from our home page.|Mute all button for moderator|Nezifah|4|False|2020-12-04 01:21:35|
"The things this app allows are crazy. No other social media platform puts me in direct contact with the people I strive to be like—it doesn’t feel one-sided at all. The app is for discussion, and that discussion happens, regardless of who you are. I’m having questions answered by people I could only dream of actually speaking to. It’s insane. 

I just hope the app stays like this to where followers represent nothing on the app, and the app keeps its casual, idea-oriented tone. We have plenty of Facebook and Instagram alternatives. In its current state, this app is super unique and has plenty to offer as an idea sharing platform."|Wonderful app!|Geeking user Shade|5|False|2021-01-18 12:57:52|
So...I’m new to the platform and as an entertainment publicist, I love the networking opportunities and more. I do have a few suggestions, in fact, they’re some of the same other reviewers have mentioned. For instance, making the speakers in a room stand out more, being able to send a message, and also a better way to add my IG account. I run several pages and I tried to add my main account, yet it pulled up another even with my password. Now, it seems like each time I try again, it still pulls up another account. If this got fixed along with the other things I believe would enhance someone’s experience, I’ll definitely come back and give it 5-stars.|A verbal high!|Mommy muse|4|False|2020-12-30 19:20:48|
So I actually never leave reviews, this is my first one. I really like this app. Something about just having voice is amazing! My only thing is, messaging. I would love to privately message people that I like on here. Having to do it outside the app can be very annoying especially when you’re trying to network. Another thing, the rooms should have a chat room options for multiple reasons: 1. Some people are introverted and don’t want to speak but would like to show agreement or make a point but can’t do so if it’s only voice. 2. Sometimes the moderators are forced to remove the hand raising option, which again limits opportunity to connect.|Love it + Recommendation|J🙅|4|False|2020-12-15 17:54:34|
I dont like that anyone who has my number can find me on the app without my consent. if I blocked someone on my phone for safety reasons it feels compromising that if they join clubhouse they can immediately find me. and the block option only keeps them out of rooms where i’m on stage. that simply isn't enough. there is an option for me to dis/connect my address book but they need an option dis/allow my contacts to find me and we should be able to toggle the option as we please. again, this is a safety concern as someone who has been stalked and harassed via phone, and I know for certain i am not the only one.

"When you use this app the correct way your limits are non existent. Lot of people not using it correctly get what THEY want out of it. 4/5 cuz there is room for some improvement on moderators abilities. Mute all mic, levels to moderation, and maybe even allowing convos to categorized instead of having a free for all timeline. If I want to enter music discussions have a that as a separate tab from sports convos or gossip talk. I think connectivity and the way you receive notifications can be fixed. 

I think once it goes public the true value could go down by scaring away useful users like celebs, industry connects etc

I have tried everything the app and Reddit threads have recommended (e.g. restart my phone or delete and redownload the app) to alleviate this issue but it is still not working. I have tried contacting the app support via the app support link provided on the App Store. The problem with this is that there is no way for the app to contact me as it does not give me the option to leave my email or other contact details. Instead, the feedback is sent directly to a town hall in the app that I can’t join or see because I’m not a member in the app...

"I believe Clubhouse is a great concept. especially for people in creative fields, business owners, entrepreneurs,etc. You can drop in on conversations but also network with people and exchange ideas, possibly come up on an opportunity you never know. I would like to see if possible as conversations are engaging if as: 

1.  A group there was a chat box where if anyone had any links they wanted to add you can type them there. 

2. If the moderator / speaker wanted to show the group a video that’s relevant to the conversation sort of like Netflix/Disney Plus Group Watch."|Absolutely Love !!!|Luvlexie|5|False|2020-11-04 18:09:54|

- include a chat room for non-mods in big rooms to chat and add links to! 
- include a questions where non-mods could ask questions while speakers are talking to continue the conversation. (Similar to how IG Lives ask questions)
- add some type of queue for speakers so people aren’t fighting for the mic"|Great App - see some consumer feedback below:|Tiger buns|5|False|2021-02-04 17:08:26|

The app though has a serious battery draining problem! Use it for an hour or two and your looking for your charger for sure. 
User interface is deliberately simplified to make it easy for everyone to get to know their way around. Could use additional buttons and functions like placing icons for rooms and grouping the rooms by subject/alphabetical order on main page instead of current one after another sorting system it has with no order at all.

"Well, the app was great and brought much fun for the first few times I used it.
But after two weeks usage, I was frustrated that I can’t train the recommender algorithm at all, and my recommendation list was always stuck with rooms I’m not interested in. For example, I didn’t check the Russian language as my interest, but yesterday, half of rooms on my list are Russian rooms. And I know my friend’s friends are hosting some interesting topics there but I can never see them on my recommendation list. Even if I have got the link to a specific room, I can only add them on the Apple or Google calendar but not the clubhouse calendar.

Is there a way to add this option so those listening can get speak with moderators without needing to raise your hand, be invited to the stage, wait your turn to speak?

Self proclaimed experts in mental health lead to Twitter feeds where they are pitching Netflix shows.

And it wasn’t just her snappy retorts but others in the room. Some actors, just everyday people.  But it sold me.  I enjoyed the randomness and freshness.  I’ve dropped into meditations and other conversations.  Only one draw back is I have only 2 referrals/invites. So it’s been hard picking who I give an invite too.

Much has been raved about Clubhouse, and rightly so. It is like a never-ending infomercial about your future self, and the only price to pay is the amount of time you spend on the app and the effort you expend to make it happen. Perhaps one might suggest the same could be said of the internet, but the level of depth this app provides in terms of immediate feedback from other users is infinitely greater.

This app is amazing, and is definitely going to have an extremely large user base here in the coming months and years as more people get invited and once it becomes public. However, I really wish this app was more compatible for Ipad. As somebody who just enjoys a bigger screen, and also eventually hopes to become a moderator and speaker, I think being able to use a larger screen and have a bigger visual of who is speaking or who is flashing their mic and asking to speak, would be extremely beneficial.|Great App!

Nothing flashy here, just good conversations & that’s what I love. The invite only feature weeds out the random people and I feel is very necessary to keep. I love how people are held  accountable for who they invite. And that pressure causes them to choose someone who will use the platform respectfully. I’m afraid when this goes public that people will flood the app with ignorance & arguments.

This app has a lot of potential, but there is so much to be improved on. First of all, it would be really nice if we had reaction features, like clapping or dislikes, something along those lines. Because when your in the audience you can’t put your input in at all and it feels very alienating, especially since there’s no typing. I think there should be a messaging feature or some sort of option to have a typed chat while talking. it’s kind of ableist that it’s audio only. what are hard of hearing people supposed to do? people who have different accents? it’s a mess of an app but i still see the potential|a very young app|User 55055|3|False|2020-12-08 04:06:02|

"You must use your phone number to set up the app. It then asks for access to your personal contacts and every time you log in it shows you the photos/profiles of every single contact you have in your phone who is on Clubhouse. It’s disturbing to me that my photo and profile are shown to every person who has ever had my number saved in their phone. 

A big red flag is that you are unable to delete your profile in the app or on their website. You must first confirm your e-mail address in the app, then e-mail them and request deletion. They have stated they will take a long time to respond via e-mail.

That way I can go to the category I’m searching for. Right now I have to scroll through every meeting. Time consuming.

"It’s a great platform that allows thoughts and ideas to be discussed while the audio humanizes those behind the screen name...even through there are trolls, they are limited because they can’t get away with just creating a bunch of anonymous accounts.

Issues:
1.) it’s not clear up front that whoever you accept an invite from lives on your profile permanently. That may not seem like an issue to most but it can create a privacy issue for some AND...

2.) you cannot delete your own account. I’ve tried to email their only customer service email daily for the past 2 weeks and they simply do not respond. It’s infuriating.

3.) reporting incidents: I’m not sure how you don’t record conversations and then enforce penalties - ie suspension and permanent ban (founders words) because they can’t review anything. Sounds like if anyone reports an account, they will take action without proof.

You need to create a way for users to be able to delete followers ASAP. It is bad enough that you force user’s contacts to be accessed in order to use the app. But from a safety and risk perspective, ppl should be able to remove any follower they like, not just have any person they don’t even know have them ability to follow them.

There appears to be no way to have your contacts removed from their server as I continue receiving notifications about contacts who sign up even though I have since revoked access to my contacts.

"I downloaded this after getting an invite.  For the first day or two I learned what it was and how to use it. Pretty easy and I was on board.  Now after. 2 weeks on the platform, here’s my honest and transparent feedback. 

1. The forums and topics are somewhat interesting until you actually get in them. You’ll find folks go off topic and the convo evolves into a much different topic and convo than was originally stated. Some moderators bring it back to center snd stay on point. Most do not. 

2. Moderators usually invite their fellow friends to talk about topics. The same people seem to be in the same topics so it gets to be redundant...fast. I like others povs but these moderators not to invite new folks to speak and share. This turned me off completely. And YES, I could of started my own topic and chat to curb all this but I got turned off by the app before I even cared to do that.

Only the moderator should be able to speak with a speaker currently online and no one should be unmuted or be able to interrupt unless it is the appropriate time if even necessary. Someone was making a pitch and was interrupted by another waiting speaker who raised her hand and she  disputed the statements of the speaker on stage at that moment and he never was able to finish his pitch.

I was initially super stoked about this app. Then I realized that they are using the same invasive trick that whatsapp was doing for years (but has since stopped doing) which is that they force you to give them access to ALL of your contacts in order for you to send an invite to ANY of them. Of course they say that it’s all anonymized. But do we really have to explain in 2021 why that is still shady and immoral? Even if *I* give permission to an app to collect all the phone numbers I have in my contacts, those numbers don’t belong to me.

- Being able to close your room once your audience is obtain. To keep out unwanted difficulties.
-Only the Head Mod. should be able to end a room and/or make others Mod.
- Mods. shouldn’t be able to pull you up from the audience without you raising your hand. Sometimes I’m just there to listen and not speak.

Pretty obvious transactional analysis design (Parent, Adult, Child) with bubbles. The more troubling part is this is backed by west coast venture capital funds attempts to buy their way into Black culture.

If you enjoy audio chatter/discussions with random people this might be fun. 
I get the appeal of the group chat without the need to worry about camera appearance. Usually I can also just not turn on my camera.

If clubhouse gets hacked or they sell their database, someone is going to get over 500 million phone numbers. This is a recipe for disaster and should be stopped immediately. (6 million users * 150 contacts per user - duplicates = ~500 million contacts total)

"I haven’t used social media apps consistently much this year because I’ve honestly just become bored with them, but this app is different. Instead of feeling like your wasting time when you could be doing something more productive you’re actually gaining knowledge, making new friends, networking, and starting life changing relationships. Another plus is that you can meet people without the worry that they’re really just bots or dealing with the image obsessed culture of other social media apps that force you to post cumbersome videos & pictures that just brainwashes society into thinking that beauty is the most important defining trait of a human beings value. Rather than far better traits like knowledge, hard work, and actual social relationships. Apps like Instagram, Twitter and Tik Tok don’t have real social relationships they have “follow relationships” and it’s wonderful to finally see an app that’s finally reversing the pathetic trends social media companies have introduced into how we think about real human interactions. 
The one recommendation I would give to the developers is to add a functioning search feature, the app only lets you see chat rooms it’s AI search ranking system thinks you’ll be interested in. Unfortunately in my case this AI tends to be wrong more often than not. Beside that thank you to the people who created this amazing app, in a year where people are more isolated than ever before this app is finally doing something to bring people together."|Best social media app in my life|Ify101|5|False|2020-12-30 03:58:22|

"Im not impressed with this app because I already spend my work days in virtual meetings.  

More importantly, I find it very strange that a “delete account” option isn’t available within the app itself. 

I’ve reached out to the app support multiple times since Jan 2021 asking to delete my account. No response.

I’ve even asked friends to report my account and still no response from app reps.

While the app is novel it’s weird you can’t rewind a little bit in case you happen to miss something. I know it’s a live format platform but the be able to even skip back 30 seconds that would be enough. A background chat feature would be helpful if you prefer to ask questions and have them be addressed without being forced to speak. Better curation and (blocking) of certain clubs. My fee is constantly bloated very irrelevant clubs that have nothing to do with my interests. Seems fairly unintelligent. Plus I also see clubs in different languages such as Chinese, Russian, or some other Asian based language. Totally fine for people who read (and speak) this language but I only speak English and I makes no sense that Im not able to filter and limit these from showing in my feed. For some reason the Instagram account link page does not work. I log in with Facebook and it never works. I also wish these was a way to hide the person that “nominated” you. It’s kinda weird that you are forced to display this info on your profile without the option to hide it. Finally, the app icon literally makes no sense and doesn’t visually capture the branding of the actual app. Why is there some random dudes head in the icon?? Who is he?? How he it relevant to Clubhouse?? I realize standardized icons are boring but they aesthetically fit with what’s already on our home screens (ex. A white stylized “C” on a taupe background, or even a stylized cartoon version of a….. clubhouse house 🏠💡). I’ll never understand the current icon and I hope the devs get out of their bubbles and change that because it’s so stupid.|Cool but some shortcomings|NonstopRug|3|False|2021-03-06 19:30:25|

"My 5-minute Clubhouse Analysis 😍

What is it: borderless meeting (of the minds) platform for people with LIKE-interests, called ""clubs"".

UX-talk:  whoever is speaking is not well highlighted. bigger/ bolder color callout colors that pulsates or enlarge speaker icon. Frustratingly, the visuals are unappealing but the content is king. New alerts have no audio alerts, in an audio only platform, don't expect people to visually pay attention.

#1 feature which I think is pretty critical is whenever you're mid conversation/ thought and you hear a golden nugget that you want to replay AND you can't! 😡

🌟Feature requests

1| Playback last 15 secs tappable x3  +  live button 

2| English only filter on alerts for ""English"" conversations only

3| Visual timeline of where you are in the conversation: beginning, middle, end... We don't live in an endless realm of space time continuum without responsibilities, help us plan our schedules accordingly. I sat in a four hour chat when i thought multiple times it is ending soon

4| Bookmarks (metrics): hot clubs have large audiences and there's no engagement metric of which part of a conversation listeners find are ""of value"". Allow for bookmarks that allows users to pick keynotes of the convo. This also allows for feedback back to host on what was valuable vs not. Maybe even go further and allow a 'golden mic' reward metric to measure engaged Hosts.

My App Review: 

🙌wow, linkedin missed out. facebook missed out. These guys are geniuses. This is the platform that gets people together. Consider it the professional / hobby /enthusiast platform, similar to FB groups. Content.... is king here. When you hop into a room that resonates, it is addictive. Think podcasts meets paid specialty webinars for FREE.

The way content is consumed, it doesn't matter whether its going to be true or not anymore, probably less wiki and more time spent on ""host"" influencers. Still not sure how they’re going to monetize, maybe eventually freemium model, supported by selling your interests/ data?? for now, who cares. 

Highly recommend using the app. Hope they grow."|Excellent content. App needs work though! ** feature requests!!|tekraid|4|False|2021-03-09 15:43:16|

"First, I love this app and I highly recommend it because wow is it packed with information. I love how easily we can connect these knowledgeable people, celebs included. So many people are active, yet it feels like I’m really in...a clubhouse! Especially since it’s the beta version. What was promised is delivered. While I’ve not yet gotten involved in a room right as it began, whenever I do pop in, I always feel like I can get right into the tips—especially from the celebrity guests. 
—The background play?? NICE. I can swipe through any profile, even go to different social media platforms within the app and still listen. It’s very easy to tap around and not feel like I’ve messed something up. 
—Love that we can search for anybody in the room or invite people. 

***LET’S GET INTO CONS***
—10 notifications an hour?? Why?? And they’re just bricks of names. Super annoying and uninviting. Maybe if I’m a *new* account you can send notifications in a similar fashion, so I can see the names I might like. However, 10 notifs is crazy. Especially if you don’t put the name of the room I’m heading into FIRST and in BOLD WITH EMOJIS. 👁
—Once I start following people and I turn on post notifications, wherever they will be, I should be notified with a buzzing notification. I appreciate that the other notifications are silent, but (next point) 🗣
—I now follow about 150 people. I don’t know which room nor do I have the desire to read through a list of names to see where those people will be. Take note from IG. Add a “following” page and show me what rooms those I follow are currently involved in/what they have coming up (with the option to tap a notification bell for that specific room, of course). Again, make sure the name of the room is first and in BOLD. You can feature names in the within that post—in
Bold if I follow them. Beneath the heading, and allow me the option to tap on the post to see a list of hyperlinked names of the moderators/speakers. Make sure those who I have post notifs turned on for are FIRST. 📌 
—Can you have a feature where you save the session for 24 hours or is it just for live viewers?
—Can the rooms be regulated? One mod said something like, “we’ve been hosting for over 10 hours! 😄” I don’t know if she meant that the one room had been going on for that long or what, but it would be nice to get a sense of not only what I’ll be listening to, but for how long it goes on. 
—Please add an applause feature, and a hand-raising feature for the speakers. Maybe add a feature where we can gift things app-only gifts to members. Like badges? Maybe I’m getting ahead of myself there. 🏅 
—When the speakers want to add something, make their circles squares or stars or something and change the color so I can see them. 
—Make it clearer what section I’m looking at. Have drop-down menus showing me where the audience is, the mods, etc. 📃 
—Add a chat feature, maybe. I’d love to be able to ask people in a chat room about what the person just said. But I don’t see a chat feature at any time. A chat feature could always start out open at the bottom half of the screen with an option to close it. Everyone would have the option to use the chat, except the speakers and mods have names in bold, badges, custom lettering, etc. As well, give the option to tap the name of an audience member’s chat to @ and respond to them. Then again, this feature could backfire. Idk. 🤔
—The speakers say to DM them, but should we not be allowed to DM them here? I understand it could be exhausting trying to answer DMs from a bunch of platforms, but how do we directly contact them as clubhouse members as opposed to just “fans”?
—The layout makes me dizzy.🤢 It just feels like a bunch of stuff everywhere. No clear lines of demarcation. 
—Maybe utilize “flyers” that are more visual rather than always a wall of text to call attention to upcoming rooms. 

That’s all for now. Thank you guys for creating/hosting such an innovative club! 😄"|10 Notifications Per Hour??|bilambilam|3|False|2021-02-28 22:42:44|

Never in my life would I expect to be listening to people I don’t know speaking about issues or topics I am passionate about from all over the world, varying levels of awareness and expertise or political persuasions. 

It is incredibly addictive in the best way possible because you are intoxicated with listening to people being FULLY human. 

YOU can HEAR their pain, passion and everything in between. Instead of people hiding behind fashion choices, fabulous backgrounds or makeup trends, you get to FOCUS on the what makes people unique- their point of view. You can SEE through viewpoint as they explain why they feel the way they do or how they came to a certain conclusion.  

The iPhone is the optimal device to be able to listen to different tones, pitch, timber, etc due to it’s superior audio quality, hence why reality shows always use iPhone for speakerphone scenes. And this is crucial to literally BE with other people.. hearing their full humanity projected over wifi. People are raw, honest and yet somehow respectful. You can HEAR people pausing, gasping, crying, laughing, thinking, searching for words or the meaning of life.. all in REAL time. And we have the opportunity to LISTEN. 

Unfortunately, The ISSUE is RACE. While Clubhouse aims to be and remain a safe space for everyone, some feel as though Black people are not welcomed, and some of the statements made by some users are dismissive and indicate a level of awareness that should have been achieve post #GeorgeFloyd 

So there needs to be more of a balance regarding creating a safe space and tools for moderators to ensure people are not traumatized or triggered while using the app. It’s a glorious, life changing and addictive odyssey, but with all things human- is isn’t perfect. I’m willing to dive DEEP into the issues and create solutions on “room” on clubhouse filled with curious, open, respectful, mindful, well intended people at a time."|BLOVING CLUBHOUSE!

"Go check your Apple privacy settings on this app...there’s no way to decide how they use your microphone. 

Just a few days ago Clubhouse gave me the option to turn off my microphone via Apple’s privacy settings. It didn’t give me the option to allow microphone usage only when in app, so I decided to only turn on the microphone when I wanted to talk.

That being said, I noticed today that there is no option to choose microphone settings anymore. One is locked in and does not have option to choose how the app uses one’s microphone. 

Users need the option to decide when the microphone is being used. Yes sure, a lot of people are signing up now and may overlook this feature, because this is a voice chat app, but it is questionable that there are no options to change the microphone settings to allow only in-app, or to set them at all.

It’s becoming easier to jump in on this platform, so it can be easy to overlook this stuff with all the hype of getting in. Giving permission for someone to have your address book feels like a small price to pay in order to “let more people in,” but a  in practice. It’s already questionable how the idea of exclusivity makes the possibility of joining more elusive and exciting...I’ve definitely fallen for it. 

I really want to be able to use this app- feels like a cool way to connect with folks. Please give us the option to change the settings. 

People are excited to get in, but let’s chill out and not download the app until Clubhouse is transparent and committed to allowing users to customize the microphone settings."|Questionable microphone privacy...alarming|Lils777|1|False|2021-03-13 22:33:28|

"So I downloaded the app seeing some international friends post about it to their Insta. I hopped quickly on the bandwagon and as soon as it finished installing I opened up the app and did the whole 9 yards,etc. it’s been two months and they are still reserving my username!? So I can’t even use the app unless I get invited which is hella annoying wish I didn’t have this problem. It’s a bummer to cause I can’t even create my own room or get the full experience everyone else is having.

"The ability to connect with people from all over the world - amazing
The ability to connect on a wide variety of topics - amazing
The lack of real support beyond an FAQ or possibility being called on in a scheduled townhall - heartless

How is there nor even a contact us form anywhere on the site?

You can have the most amazing car, but if a minor fender bender puts your life at risk, no longer so amazing.

Upon opening the app today it was as if the app had never been opened before, asked me my name and for a new username  🤔
Upon then getting in my olde profile was there with Picture and creator name and so I tapped the new user name so I could change it back to the original but it says you can only change it once.....I NEVER SELECTED AN OPTION TO CHANGE USER NAME the app prompted my at startup to create a new account.  It always logged right into my account b4.....

Searched the website, FAQ no answers and your Twitter account doesn’t allow for message contact.....so y’all left me on an island with out a solution to a glitchy app....and I’ve lost my identity 😪

Nothing against the app, really excited for something refreshing in the social media space. But the initial excitement is no longer there, and the reason is the people getting on the platform. This will be further fueled by more people coming on the platform and getting people on the Android platform onboard. Trust people to ruin anything good happening. Wish the Clubhouse team good luck, but I see less reason to get on the platform and I guess I’m an abandoner.|Great concept ruined by the people getting on it|Srinaith|4|False|2021-03-14 03:37:20|

"Besides music, I don’t do much audio but Clubhouse is something I’m definitely starting to enjoy. It may take a while to find which clubs and rooms that interest you, depending on what you like. I highly recommend giving it a try!

The only things I would recommend that they add to the app is an option to view a Club’s calendar while on the club page. When viewing the “Upcoming Events” on the main calendar page, you’re likely to see dozens of events. Sometimes I just want to see upcoming events for a particular club. 

Also, while in a live room it can be difficult to see which member is speaking. Maybe they can change that highlighted gray border of the speaker to a more noticeable color or shade border. (03.13.2021)"|I’m Warming Up to It 😊|Studio_R|4|False|2021-03-13 18:34:39|

"This is literally the best app I’ve ever had the privilege to use in my entire life.

It’s all audio and human connection. The developers show up every single week to make sure to get feedback from the users and are continuously making improvements.

The best part is how they have their no policy trolls, bully, overall mean people set up. This is invite only so who ever invite someone to the app is also responsible for that person, meaning,If someone is being a bully, troll were using hate speech then they are reported and if the developer said that they are banned from this app as well as the person who gave them the invite.

And guess what, invites are earned by how much you give to the app and the communities there.

People are showing up who are brilliant brilliant human beings that we literally get to have conversations with.

Imagine having access to a speaking engagement for free from your home with some of the greatest minds out there and the ability to ask them questions for free.

This app is for people who give their time and don’t ask for anything in return because they want to collectively serve the community as a human race.

This app has restored my faith in humanity as I can hear and connect with people that are athletic and genuine.

Are there opportunities for fun? Comedy? Shark Tank pitch rooms? Finding Capital and being an angel investor account? Discussing mental health topics? Support for mothers, men, couples, Artist, physicians, dentists, coaches, speakers, Podcasters, music engineer, music artist, yes. That is what I haveAt the top of my mind.

Could this be great for business opportunities? Absolutely, but of course if you know so good and marketers ruin everything LOL but there is a classy way to do things after you’ve net worth and connecting with people.

If you have an iPhone download this app and hopefully your friend in your contact list and you can see for yourself.

And because I’m here Typing out this review, I might as well let you all know that you can find my clubs “self care curators”  and “ conscious couples quote from JennyAHansen.

If you find me from this review please message me and let me know because that would add a whole new level of cool to this entire community and apps abilities.

Lots of love! Have a beautiful and amazing day.

Clubhouse is straight forward and very interesting. In many ways it reminds me of an old platform from the 90s called Paltalk. The difference is that this is audio only and it’s really a network building tool.Another cool aspect is the fact that it’s invite only. This kind of puts you in a space of responsibility for the people that you invite. Which means, at least I hope, that there won’t be many trolls on this platform. My only challenge is that I’ve been on for about four days now and in a group for new users, they say we can create our own clubs and suggested we should do so within our first seven days. They explained that there was a new update that allowed for us to create a new club and that we could use it by going down to the clubs that were a member of and clicking the plus symbol and then proceeding to create that new club. There was an issue with that and one member was told that they should uninstall the app and then reinstall it and that should get them the most recent update which was yesterday. I did that exact thing, and found that high am not able to make a club. The messaging states that I have to be one of the top users to make a club. So that was disappointing. I can, however, create a room. I think the rooms you create disappear when you leave them. I am excited to learn more and would definitely give 5 stars if I could make a club.|Definitely Worth Exploring|DaisyRo8|4|False|2021-03-06 16:38:38|

The only way to send an invite to someone is to give access to all your contacts to this app. A functionality that can be easily provided without any access to contacts by just generating a unique code is suspicious to see it being implemented in a way that only helps the company collect people's names, phone numbers and emails. It's a major privacy intrusion for no benefit for the user. I hope this app dies a fast and painful death when it stops being the next big thing or whatever.

CH is a disruptive social network for sure, but their customer growth has outpaced the pace of beta development/testing. As a user, I’m furious about leaving a trail of all the rooms I hopped in and at which time. This is equivalent to sharing my google and YouTube search history, what I read on the internet and how much time I spend on social media channels. No one wants their followers to know all this. At first this app was cool since we can connect with new people around the world, but now with family members, professors, close friends and coworkers following me, I have to be cautious about when and what rooms I join. This will result in less engagement on the app. Their recent new feature on reporting trolls is interesting; I understand their intentions are good but they haven’t thought it through. People are abusing it to knock off their competition and getting 4-5 friends to report the same person. This takes the “troll’s” voice away, when they weren’t even trolling in the first place.

This app hands down!! Greatest invention. Amazing way to network. Just a suggestion, if it hasn’t already been suggested, PLEASE ADD A SEARCH BAR, for people who create very large rooms. Trying to find people in large rooms gets complicated when you have over 900-1000 people in it, especially on stage (ex industry connect room). I want to follow everyone and connect with everyone but either they get kicked out because of glitches or other reasons. Overall, Thank you, thank you, thank you for this app. It is AH-mazing.|WE NEED A SEARCH BAR IN LARGE ROOMS|Kyiapowpow|5|False|2020-12-29 00:49:18|

Without a doubt, this has become my favorite app in one week.  The conversations, the gems, the quality & the friendships being made on here are next level.

"I think it's terrible for a app to be a ""secret invite only"". So others can get on and use it and others have to wait unless you get an invite.

I’m giving this one star because of how serious this issue is: the block feature on this app is a JOKE. Someone that I have blocked on EVERY SINGLE OTHER SOCIAL PLATFORM has followed me. I blocked him on Clubhouse yet he is still able to view AND follow me on there. That does not make sense. Please fix this.

The app is cool. I like the “status” ability that everybody cannot gain access as if yet. I enjoy the anti android aspect. Listening to a “room” about aliens right now.

I am liking the app so far and I definitely enjoy the conversations I’ve had. I see the potential that this app has for connecting people. My only complaint is that I only received 1 invite and sent it to someone who has an android not knowing that this app is only available for people who have ios/iphones for the time being. I’d love to send an invite to another friend who could use it but I don’t have any more. It would have been helpful for the app to give me a heads up or even for the invite to bounce back or something. Also, it appears that some people received 5 invites and some received less so I’m not sure what the reason is for why there’s a disparity in how the invites are allocated.|Great Except for Invite Issue|lenaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa j|4|False|2020-11-09 04:09:40|
